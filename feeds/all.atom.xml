&lt;p&gt;I gave an autobiographical talk today to the &lt;a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/graduate/ensure"&gt;EnSURE&lt;/a&gt; (Engineering Summer Undergraduate Research Experience) students. I have given this talk a few times and it is noticeably different that most of my presentations because the EnSURE organizers asked me to talk about myself and how I got where I am (instead of research or teaching).  The first time I gave this talk it was really awkward.  However, now I think it is kind of fun to tell stories about the choices I made throughout school and my carrier.  I get a lot of questions when I am done so I like to think the student's enjoyed the talk as well.  Here are a copy of my slides:&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, Twitter Feed is no longer around and their website recommended &lt;a href="http://dlvr.it"&gt;dlvr.it&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it was fairly strait forward to set up an account and I followed the menus to connect my &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; RSS feed to my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/colbrydi"&gt;Titter&lt;/a&gt; account. At first it didn't seem to do anything but then I noticed a message that said something like "Last checked 56 seconds ago" and I went back to my Twitter account and all of my blog posts had been tweeted.  Which is what I wanted so Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there were a lot of options that I didn't understand.  For example, I thought it would only tweet the latest blog post.  It didn't, it tweeted them all. Which is fine, this is where I wanted to go but I was hoping to test it first before blasting all of my twitter followers (I do not think I have many).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem was that it only tweeted the title and the URL which is not very detailed. I don't want to everyone to be required to go to my blog post.  I found an option to also include the body of the post.  We will see if that does anything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this post as a test.&lt;/p&gt;

I learned this technique from Dr. Brian O'Shea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Michigan State University (MSU) my official title is curriculum specialist.  I have the unique opportunity to help develop entirely new courses for a brand new department (Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering CMSE, EST 2015).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague (Dr. Brian O'Shea) showed me a nice trick to organize my semester and brainstorm ideas to do a better job with backward design and matching up my lessons to my learning goals.  I make a grid of 3 rows with 5 columns on a whiteboard.  Each box represents one week of the semester (15 total).  I then use post-it notes to write down ideas and place them on the board.  This is a brainstorming stage where all ideas are equal.  If I do this early enough I can leave the board up and move the sticky notes around as I think about my learning goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MarkerBoard Grid" src="./Images/markdown-img-paste-20180610141148377.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently moved away from the whiteboard and use a blank wall in my office. I created the grid with painters tape. This leaves my whiteboard open for other ideas and lets me put up a board really early. For example, it is June and I have a board up for my Spring Course on Parallel programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Painters Tape Wall" src="./Images/markdown-img-paste-20180610140831494.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have been desinging many courses I may just leave the painters tape up.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>Spark mail</title><link href="/spark-mail.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-06-06:/spark-mail.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="Spark Logo" src="https://sparkmailapp.com/img/spark2/common/spark.svg" width="20%,"&gt;

I am weird that I like email.  It is my preferred form of communication on projects (maybe I am just getting old).  I trust that I will get to my email and that I will not loose things.  I realize that this trust is often not true but it is true enough for me to keep productive. For the longest time Gmail was my favorite email application. However, work changed policy from "we highly recommend you don't use Gmail" to "don't use gmail".  So I chose to switch to the university Office 365 accounts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the built-in Mac mail program.  It didn't thread my email the way I prefer.  I also tried outlook which had its own problems.  I don't really feel like bashing this software, it just didn't work in a way that fit my Gmail workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I move into a new laptop I stubbled across the spark email client. About three weeks into using it I am very satisfied. The laptop and phone versions work nicely together. I really like having both my personal Gmail account and work accounts connected in one application.  There are a lot of things I like but probably the best is that since using Spark I have gotten my inbox to zero almost every day.  This is big news. I am a big fan of emptying my inbox but this is often a challenge.  I like the fact that Spark will allow me to show badges with the number of messages in my inbox instead of the number of unread messages.  For some reason this is a real motivator for getting my email where they need to be. It also helps me keep my Gmail clean which is mostly news feeds, advertisements, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Product Reviews"></category><category term="Lifehacking"></category></entry><entry><title>Inverse Problems Seminar</title><link href="/inverse-problems-seminar.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-06-04:/inverse-problems-seminar.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was invited to give a talk at the inverse seminars symposium:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was a little nervous since I don't consider myself an expert in inverse problems so I did not fully understand what they wanted me to present. However after talking to the organizers (Kirk and James), I discovered what they wanted was a high level talk and overview of advanced computing. This was something I could do! I put together snippets from a variety of my previous talks. Here is a link to the slides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./Images/20180604-InverseProblems.pdf"&gt;20180604-InverseProblems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I planned for a 60 minute talk but only ended up with 45 minutes (at most) of content. Luckly for me the organizers only really wanted a 30 Minutes talk and in the end I was relaxed and able to get though my slides at a reasonable pace in 20 minutes which led to 10 minutes of questions which turned out to be perfect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the Inverse Problems Symposium was a great event and I learned a lot. I was honored to be invited to give a talk. I was even considering attending next year at Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I stubbled across &lt;a href="https://www.jjrobots.com/"&gt;JJRobots&lt;/a&gt; and I just love the idea of this company.  They sell a kit of electronic parts to maker hobbyists with access to 3D printers.   The idea is that you use your 3D printer to make the items and everything you can't print is in the kit provided by JJRobots.  They spend their time developing new products that you can print with the same kit.  For example, the kit I purchased can be used to build the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marker board writer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotic arm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motorized Camera slider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini Robotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Hocky Robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that print was tricky and my printer has been on the fritz lately (see other posts) and I haven't had the time/space to fix it.  However, my family and I are moving to a bigger house with a dedicated maker space so I hope to start working on projects again.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maker"></category><category term="Product Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Remember the Milk</title><link href="/remember-the-milk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-05-19:/remember-the-milk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been a paid subscriber and dedicated customer to Remember the Milk (RTM) for many years (I have lost count).

A few years ago I maintained a blog when I worked for the Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (iCER) at Michigan State University (MSU). At iCER I did a lot of High Performance Computing (HPC) User support. This involved mostly helping researchers figure out how to use advanced computing systems in their research.  I got into a habit of writing up a blog post when I learned something new or figured out a solution to a practical technical problem.  I also found the blog useful for posting slides and examples from presentations I would often make at workshops and conferences. Many of these old posts are still see a little traffic.

&lt;p&gt;I also did some blogging related to my kids and our "maker" hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://apprenticemaker.blogspot.com/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I moved away from working directly for iCER and have not done a good job keeping up with my maker blog. I am going to try to bring the blogging habit back into my workflow.   I am currently in the middle of quite a few projects relating to education and large scale computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of goals for writing a blog. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting over my reluctance to share and communicate in online communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping me organize and be accountable for my projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting with people with similar interests to my own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing informations that others may find helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach these goals I am going to try to get into a daily habit of writing.  I don't think I will post a blog everyday but the writing habit is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifehacking"></category></entry><entry><title>CNC Mill Picking</title><link href="/cnc-mill-picking.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-05-18:/cnc-mill-picking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am interested in purchasing a CNC machine for the shop space in our new house.

I think I would like to stick to something around $1000 but would be willing to invest as much as $2000 if I can find the right machine.  There are a lot of choices in this price range for hobby CNC machines.  Some other selection criteria include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big cut area (I would love 4'x8' but that seems a lot) - I am interested in trying out thigns you can do with furniture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small detailed work - I also have a few small projects that require detail.  I realize it will be difficult to have a machine that does both big and small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source hardware (I just like these projects) - Something I can easily modify with a rich user community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my inicial search I came accross the following systems and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sienci: https://sienci.com/product/sienci-mill-one-kit/
DiyLilcnc: http://diylilcnc.org/bigshoulders/
Shapeoko: carbide3d.com/shapeoko/
X-Carve: https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/
Openbuild community: https://openbuilds.com/?category=cartesian-style-cnc&amp;amp;id=287&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled across the "Maslow" (http://www.maslowcnc.com/) and got really excited. The large format capabilities (4'x8') with the really low price ($350) would leave more than enough in my budget to buy two machies.  In fact, I may be able to buy a Maslow and then use it to make the parts I would need another project like the DiyLilcnc (Although I just realized the kickstart for that is relly old 2011).  There are probably other projects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maker"></category><category term="CNC"></category></entry><entry><title>Picking Blog Software</title><link href="/picking-blog-software.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-05-18:/picking-blog-software.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was at iCER we used confluence for our &lt;a href="https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/~colbrydi@msu.edu/Dirk%27s+iCER+wiki+homepage"&gt;blogging software&lt;/a&gt; and when I did a (personal blog](http://apprenticemaker.blogspot.com/) I used google blogger.

On of the barriers for me getting back into blogging (besides my own personal hangups) is that I was never really satisified with either solution.  I wanted to "own" my blog information and didn't really feel comfortable with advertisers making money directly from my content (this is it's own argument).  Here are some criteria for what I was looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to edit/ add new content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily backed up to my own computer and ported to a different system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to modify and add my own tweaks/ features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses markdown or some similar text based file format to make it easy to use linux commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some digging and talking to people I decided that I wanted to try out a static website generation tool and the obvious one that seemed to fit my interests and criteria is Pelican and a git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Pelican was not as easy as I had hoped.  On two different occasions over the last couple of years I have made a deliberate effort to build a new website using Pelican.  It "worked" but there was some missing feature or bug that would get in my way actually making me adopt the format.  I also think that my reluctance to post things makes it harder for me to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as I write this blog post (in markdown) I do not actually have a blog to post it on.  My hope is that having some posts already waiting "in the hopper" will make my use of the software easier.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of one of my summer students, I am making an effort to try to come up with a useable version of a blog using Pelican.  My feeling is that active open source projects are constantly evolving and therefore getting better. Maybe third time is a charm?  If Pelican still does not work out I may need to explore a different platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I would like a workflow that not only works for my blog but also for some of other projects that need websites.  I also would like to try to make a kind of Pelican template repository that I can give to some of my peers and make it quick and easy for them to start their own website/blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blogging"></category><category term="Product Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Jupyter Accessability Project</title><link href="/jupyter-accessability-project.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-05-17:/jupyter-accessability-project.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My university (Michigan State University) plans to scale up the use of Jupyter in our classrooms but we need to address accessibility issues before we can adopt the platform for wide scale use.  On behalf of MSU I had an external group conduct a preliminary audit of our current jupyterhub …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My university (Michigan State University) plans to scale up the use of Jupyter in our classrooms but we need to address accessibility issues before we can adopt the platform for wide scale use.  On behalf of MSU I had an external group conduct a preliminary audit of our current jupyterhub server.  Based on this audit we determined that finding ways to improve Jupyter for the following user communities would be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who have some one of the more common types of colorblindness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who use screen readers to help with understanding (ex. Dyslexia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals with dexterity issues who cannot effectively use a mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For part of my Jupyter hub project I am going to try to address these issues.  My hope is that some people are already working on these issues and I can just integrate existing plugins or patches.  However, If these communities can not be found I will try to build one myself.  I am currently talking with leaders in the Jupyter community to see the best way to build such a community.  Feel free to send me an email (colbrydi@msu.edu) and I would be happy to include you in on the conversation once I figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jupyter"></category><category term="Accessibility"></category></entry><entry><title>ACI-REF Talk</title><link href="/aci-ref-talk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-08-02:/aci-ref-talk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Research and Education Facilitator (ACI-REF) Virtual Residency workshop 2017 is intended for individuals who are responsible for helping researchers with computational and data-intensive research how to be more effective at demonstrating how to use cyberinfrastructure resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an amazing resource for CI Facilitators trying to get a start on their campus and there were many talks/activities I fould related closely to the CyberAmbassador program.  In particular I found the following to be related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_effectivecommunication_neeman_20170731.pdf"&gt;Effective Communication: How to Talk to Researchers about Their Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_effectivecommunication_neeman_20170731.pdf"&gt;How to Do an Intake Interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_ciusersupport_colbry_20170803.pdf"&gt;Cyberinfrastructure User Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the week Henry also had lots of small useful communication tidbits and we had an amazing Ad-hoc talk about how to communicate effectively using email.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, just before attending the CyberAmbassador grant was funded.  I managed to talk to the ACI-REF organizers (Henry Neman and Dana Brunson) about the grant and they found time in the schedule to let me talk to the audience.  Here is a link to my CyberAmbassador slides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_cyberambassadors_colbry_20170802.pdf"&gt;CyberAmbassador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk turned out to be great.  78&lt;strong&gt;+40&lt;/strong&gt; people were at the conference with &lt;strong&gt;40&lt;/strong&gt; in person and 78 calling in remotely. There seemed to be a lot of enthusiasm for the program  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category><category term="CyberAmbassador"></category></entry></feed>
