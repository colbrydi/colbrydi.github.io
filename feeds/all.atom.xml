&lt;li&gt;Mariya Vyushkova, U Notre Dame re Quantum Computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was invited to this panel to share based on the work we are doing at the CMSE department related to FPGAs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchased 2 nodes with Altera FPGAs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started a FPGA Taskforce for interested researchers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with a Graduate Student (Ahmed Yousif) on an independent study related to an optimization problem (function fitting) on FPGAs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This fall CMSE plans to conduct a Graduate Course to benchmark and test the 7 dwarves algorithms&lt;/li&gt;

Since many of the participants were virtual I experimented with doing a Brainstorming exercise over zoom. We had local volunteers on typing in comments from our local participants and remote participants typing their comments directly into the zoom group chat.  I tried my best to use typical brainstorming techniques and repeat all of the comments so everyone could hear them. This was especially important since remote participates could not hear the local participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some growing pains related to getting zoom breakout rooms working with a large group of people calling in.  Some didn't have working mics, others work in a group room and could not talk, others just didn't feel like participating.  Overall though I think it worked out well especially during the second breakout when we had a little more time.  Check out the slides on the CyberAmbassador website:&lt;/p&gt;

The entire paper was written virtually over weekly video conference meetings and included the thirteen sited (maximum) authors and I think dozens of other contributors.  Henry does an amazing job coordinating this army of people, soliciting their input and giving them opportunities to learn.   I am looking forward to the ACI-Ref Virtual Residency workshop in a couple of weeks so I can see everyone again in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Description: &lt;/strong&gt;
Cyberinfrastructure facilitation -- working directly with researchers to advance the computing-intensive and data-intensive aspects of their investigations, especially via large-scale and advanced computing -- has emerged as a crucial component of research computing processes. However, because no national formal education curriculum exists to cultivate the needed workforce, informal education is the most viable approach. The Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Research and Education Facilitator (ACI-REF) Virtual Residency (VR) program, in operation since summer 2015, is a national informal education program that trains Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Facilitators on effective methods for serving their research and education constituents, especially focusing on professional (soft) skills (because much of the technical content that facilitators need is available via other opportunities). The VR consists primarily of (a) summer weeklong intensive workshops that provide both content and experiences in facilitation, (b) biweekly conference calls that expand upon both the kinds of topics introduced in the workshops and additional content and experiences, (c) meetings at national conferences and (d) a grant proposal writing apprenticeship. Future plans focus on extending the VR model to intermediate and advanced levels, as well as disseminating a "train-the-trainers-of-trainers" approach to teaching other organizations to conduct their own VR activities within their own CI Facilitator communities, in order to expand the VR's scale, scope, and reach. The VR program and its offshoots have already served 364 CI professionals at 188 institutions across the US and internationally. Virtual Residents are positioned to advance to the intermediate level and beyond, and ultimately to become institutional and national CI leaders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category><category term="Publication"></category></entry><entry><title>Fitting iCE-Cube Neutrino Path models using Neural Networks</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/fitting-ice-cube-neutrino-path-models-using-neural-networks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-07-24:/fitting-ice-cube-neutrino-path-models-using-neural-networks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="Mohammed and his poster" hspace="10" src="./images/Mohammed.jpg" width="20%,"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poster Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;: Neutrinos are small particles with a mass close to zero. It’s rare interaction with normal matter makes it difficult to determine its precise mass. Researchers in the the Ice Cube project are working on determining neutrinos precise mass. The Ice Cube project is a sub particle detector in the south pole that records the interactions of neutrinos. The detector is a 150 KM grid with a hexagonal shape 1 km under Ice. Each hole in the grid has a 1 km string, each with about 60 light sensors. Since a neutrino is faster than the speed of light in ice, it emits light in ice. Therefore, the emitted photon is detected by the sensors in the detector. Using the measurements from the detector, we can determine angle, origin, speed, and energy using analytics and machine learning. The interest in this project is to identify neutrinos have come from the center of the galaxy. To check if machine learning is an appropriate method for this project, we create a virtual ice cube simulator using phantom data generation method to simplify and control the data set. Then we use machine learning on this data to determine if it is an appropriate method for this problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category></entry><entry><title>Campus Champions 101 Panel at PEARC18</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/campus-champions-101-panel-at-pearc18.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-07-23:/campus-champions-101-panel-at-pearc18.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="Campus Champion Logo Logo" hspace="10" src="https://www.xsede.org/wwwteragrid/archive/image/image_gallery%3Fuuid=554fecca-1a37-44d0-826f-afad9470153d&amp;amp;groupId=298192&amp;amp;t=1291845274821" width="20%,"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//pearc18.conference-program.com/?page_id=10&amp;amp;id=bof122&amp;amp;sess=sess203"&gt;Link to BOF Schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Description: &lt;/strong&gt;
A number of professional skills training programs and resources have been developed in recent years, in part due to the efforts of the NSF CyberTraining Initiative. The goal of this BOF is to bring these groups together and explore ways to share information and coordinate efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the integration of CI in research continues, CI Professionals find themselves tackling problems and consulting on projects that are increasingly complex and collaborative. In order to respond to these various requests, CI Professionals need both the expertise to solve computational challenges and the professional skills to work effectively with individuals and teams who have diverse backgrounds, experiences, and goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers of this BOF will facilitate conversations and brainstorming activities within this interactive session, with the goal of identifying opportunities to build on each other’s success and develop ongoing collaborations. For example, authors of open-source professional skills curricula might meet experienced facilitators with an interest in bringing their content to new audiences. Or content developers might identify gaps in available resources and develop new partnerships to address these needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This BOF is proposed by a team that has received NSF CyberTraining funds to develop open-source, professional skills training in communication, teamwork and leadership for CI Professionals along with a “train the trainers” module to facilitate national access to these materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category></entry><entry><title>Pelican Github.io Tutorial</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/pelican-githubio-tutorial.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-07-17:/pelican-githubio-tutorial.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="Pelican Github.io  Logo" hspace="10" src="//docs.google.com/a/msu.edu/drawings/d/slwvmwORPg9obcema4qeYEg/image?parent=e/2PACX-1vRGU8icBbrWq1sHjWR3oDeCjeVVY_xgl2-aq1T3iTFxFMYiBdrv73kwax9A-P4pXXV_Wy6RwVtcG1Cz&amp;amp;rev=6&amp;amp;h=200&amp;amp;w=182&amp;amp;ac=1" width="20%,"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These instructions are for installing RStudio on the HPCC. RStudio provides a variety of installers on their website &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/"&gt;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;These instructions are for installing RStudio on the HPCC. RStudio provides a variety of installers on their website &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/"&gt;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/&lt;/a&gt;. However, the HPCC uses an older version of Linux and the precompiled binaries are not compatible.  Trying to install RStudio from the source code is an option but is also difficult due to the large numbers of libraries and compile dependancies.  I basically gave up trying to install RStudio on until I realized that a version is included as an option in Anaconda.  The following instructions show how to install RStudio using Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 0:&lt;/strong&gt; Connect to the HPC.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use ssh to connect to the HPCC and make sure you have a working X11 server (ex. MobaXterm on windows or XQuarts on Mac).  More information about X11 can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="//wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Installing+an+X-server+on+Windows"&gt;Old HPCC Windows instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Installing+an+X-server++for+Macs"&gt;Old HPCC Mac Instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Download the Linux Anaconda installers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the latest Linux installer on the &lt;a href="//www.anaconda.com/download/#linux"&gt;Anaconda website&lt;/a&gt;. Right click on the download button for version 3.x and select "Copy Link". Use the &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; command on the hpcc to download the script file by typing wget and then pasting the url. For Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Install anaconda using the defaults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the downloaded script in bash using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;bash ./Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The last question will ask you to add the anaconda folder to your bashrc file. Say yes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Install RStudio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the conda install command to install RStudio.  Note you may need to run &lt;code&gt;source ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; first to update your path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;conda install rstudio
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That should be it, RStudio is now installed in your home directory on the HPCC.  The only other thing you will need is a X11 server.  Assuming you have connected to the hpcc with an X11 connection you can run rstudio from the command line by typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;rstudio

This user is running a lot of jobs with 512 cores (current cpu limit is 520).  The problem is that it is really difficult for the user to estimate the walltimes. There is a 2x difference in walltimes on the HPCC.  The code has been tested on other large scale systems with much less variation. The user would prefer more consistent runtimes and did not mind waiting in the queue (although less queue time is better).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there are many things that can impact the runtime of a job. The HPCC runs at over 95% utilization most of the time so many of the resources are in contention.  Without additional information, my best guess is that the bottleneck is MPI communication over the high speed network. If this is the case, I hypothesize that moving more processes to the same nodes (instead of spread across the cluster) will help reduce network competition with other users and result in more consistent walltimes. Here are some things I suggested the user try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a ticket with iCER and see if you can set up a consulting appointment. They may be able to get much better idea about what resources are in contention and causing the bottleneck: &lt;a href="https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact"&gt;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add “qstat -f ${PBS_JOBID}” to the end of the jobscript.  This will provide some stats that may help us understand differences between jobs that run fast and slow.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try different core and node ratios (ex. nodes=128:ppn=4, nodes=64:ppn=8, nodes=32:ppn=8 etc.). Although increasing the ppn will likely make queue times longer, i believe the overall runtime will be more consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the process to get DOE and XSEDE allocations.  Create XSEDE Portal account here: &lt;a href="https://portal.xsede.org/"&gt;https://portal.xsede.org/&lt;/a&gt; and send me your login name when you get it so we can add you to the MSU campus champion account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have a similar problem?  Other suggestions that I may have missed?&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, Twitter Feed is no longer around and their website recommended &lt;a href="//dlvr.it"&gt;dlvr.it&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it was fairly strait forward to set up an account and I followed the menus to connect my &lt;a href="//docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; RSS feed to my &lt;a href="//twitter.com/colbrydi"&gt;Titter&lt;/a&gt; account. At first it didn't seem to do anything but then I noticed a message that said something like "Last checked 56 seconds ago" and I went back to my Twitter account and all of my blog posts had been tweeted.  Which is what I wanted so Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there were a lot of options that I didn't understand.  For example, I thought it would only tweet the latest blog post.  It didn't, it tweeted them all. Which is fine, this is where I wanted to go but I was hoping to test it first before blasting all of my twitter followers (I do not think I have many).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem was that it only tweeted the title and the URL which is not very detailed. I don't want to everyone to be required to go to my blog post.  I found an option to also include the body of the post.  We will see if that does anything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this post as a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a setting in dlvr.it that I turned on to "Post Body".  This let more come though the twitter feed and nicely includes an image.  This makes the behavior act as expected so I am really excited.  Oddly, this particular post is not seen on Twitter.  This is because I went over the 10 post limit on dlvr.it.   I am going to change the post date to today and see if that helps things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Changing the date in the post didn't seem to trigger dlvr.it to post this message on twitter. I am now changing the filename inside of pelican to see if that changes the RSS feed enough to make dlvr.it think this is a new post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Changing the pelican filename didn't do anything either. I looked though the RSS feed and now I think maybe changing the post title will make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blogging"></category><category term="Product Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Ensure Talk - An Engineers Autobiography</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/ensure-talk-an-engineers-autobiography.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-06-27:/ensure-talk-an-engineers-autobiography.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EnSURE Logo" src="//www.egr.msu.edu/graduate/sites/default/files/content/ensure_logo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I have given this talk a few times and it is noticeably different that most of my presentations because the EnSURE organizers asked me to talk about myself and how I got where I am (instead of research or teaching).  The first time I gave this talk it was really awkward.  However, now I think it is kind of fun to tell stories about the choices I made throughout school and my carrier.  I get a lot of questions when I am done so I like to think the student's enjoyed the talk as well.  Here are a copy of my slides:&lt;/p&gt;

I learned this technique from Dr. Brian O'Shea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Michigan State University (MSU) my official title is curriculum specialist.  I have the unique opportunity to help develop entirely new courses for a brand new department (Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering CMSE, EST 2015).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague (Dr. Brian O'Shea) showed me a nice trick to organize my semester and brainstorm ideas to do a better job with backward design and matching up my lessons to my learning goals.  I make a grid of 3 rows with 5 columns on a whiteboard.  Each box represents one week of the semester (15 total).  I then use post-it notes to write down ideas and place them on the board.  This is a brainstorming stage where all ideas are equal.  If I do this early enough I can leave the board up and move the sticky notes around as I think about my learning goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MarkerBoard Grid" src="./Images/markdown-img-paste-20180610141148377.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently moved away from the whiteboard and use a blank wall in my office. I created the grid with painters tape. This leaves my whiteboard open for other ideas and lets me put up a board really early. For example, it is June and I have a board up for my Spring Course on Parallel programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Painters Tape Wall" src="./Images/markdown-img-paste-20180610140831494.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have been desinging many courses I may just leave the painters tape up.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>Spark mail</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/spark-mail.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-06-06:/spark-mail.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right," alt="Spark Logo" hspace="10" src="//sparkmailapp.com/img/spark2/common/spark.svg" width="20%,"&gt;

I am weird that I like email.  It is my preferred form of communication on projects (maybe I am just getting old).  I trust that I will get to my email and that I will not loose things.  I realize that this trust is often not true but it is true enough for me to keep productive. For the longest time Gmail was my favorite email application. However, work changed policy from "we highly recommend you don't use Gmail" to "don't use gmail".  So I chose to switch to the university Office 365 accounts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the built-in Mac mail program.  It didn't thread my email the way I prefer.  I also tried outlook which had its own problems.  I don't really feel like bashing this software, it just didn't work in a way that fit my Gmail workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I move into a new laptop I stubbled across the spark email client. About three weeks into using it I am very satisfied. The laptop and phone versions work nicely together. I really like having both my personal Gmail account and work accounts connected in one application.  There are a lot of things I like but probably the best is that since using Spark I have gotten my inbox to zero almost every day.  This is big news. I am a big fan of emptying my inbox but this is often a challenge.  I like the fact that Spark will allow me to show badges with the number of messages in my inbox instead of the number of unread messages.  For some reason this is a real motivator for getting my email where they need to be. It also helps me keep my Gmail clean which is mostly news feeds, advertisements, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Product Reviews"></category><category term="Lifehacking"></category></entry><entry><title>Inverse Problems Seminar</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/inverse-problems-seminar.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-06-04:/inverse-problems-seminar.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was invited to give a talk at the inverse seminars symposium:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//inverseproblems2018.org/"&gt;https://inverseproblems2018.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was a little nervous since I don't consider myself an expert in inverse problems so I did not fully understand what they wanted me to present. However after talking to the organizers (Kirk and James), I discovered what they wanted was a high level talk and overview of advanced computing. This was something I could do! I put together snippets from a variety of my previous talks. Here is a link to the slides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./Images/20180604-InverseProblems.pdf"&gt;20180604-InverseProblems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I planned for a 60 minute talk but only ended up with 45 minutes (at most) of content. Luckly for me the organizers only really wanted a 30 Minutes talk and in the end I was relaxed and able to get though my slides at a reasonable pace in 20 minutes which led to 10 minutes of questions which turned out to be perfect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the Inverse Problems Symposium was a great event and I learned a lot. I was honored to be invited to give a talk. I was even considering attending next year at Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I stubbled across &lt;a href="//www.jjrobots.com/"&gt;JJRobots&lt;/a&gt; and I just love the idea of this company.  They sell a kit of electronic parts to maker hobbyists with access to 3D printers.   The idea is that you use your 3D printer to make the items and everything you can't print is in the kit provided by JJRobots.  They spend their time developing new products that you can print with the same kit.  For example, the kit I purchased can be used to build the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marker board writer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotic arm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motorized Camera slider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini Robotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Hocky Robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I have only built the Eggbot but it was awesome!  We spent last easter painting egg shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that print was tricky and my printer has been on the fritz lately (see other posts) and I haven't had the time/space to fix it.

A few years ago I maintained a blog when I worked for the Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (iCER) at Michigan State University (MSU). At iCER I did a lot of High Performance Computing (HPC) User support. This involved mostly helping researchers figure out how to use advanced computing systems in their research.  I got into a habit of writing up a blog post when I learned something new or figured out a solution to a practical technical problem.  I also found the blog useful for posting slides and examples from presentations I would often make at workshops and conferences. Many of these old posts are still see a little traffic.

&lt;p&gt;I also did some blogging related to my kids and our "maker" hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//apprenticemaker.blogspot.com/"&gt;Maker Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I moved away from working directly for iCER and have not done a good job keeping up with my maker blog. I am going to try to bring the blogging habit back into my workflow.   I am currently in the middle of quite a few projects relating to education and large scale computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of goals for writing a blog. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting over my reluctance to share and communicate in online communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping me organize and be accountable for my projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting with people with similar interests to my own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing informations that others may find helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach these goals I am going to try to get into a daily habit of writing.  I don't think I will post a blog everyday but the writing habit is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifehacking"></category></entry><entry><title>CNC Mill Picking</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/cnc-mill-picking.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-05-18:/cnc-mill-picking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am interested in purchasing a CNC machine for the shop space in our new house.

I think I would like to stick to something around $1000 but would be willing to invest as much as $2000 if I can find the right machine.  There are a lot of choices in this price range for hobby CNC machines.  Some other selection criteria include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big cut area (I would love 4'x8' but that seems a lot) - I am interested in trying out thigns you can do with furniture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small detailed work - I also have a few small projects that require detail.  I realize it will be difficult to have a machine that does both big and small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source hardware (I just like these projects) - Something I can easily modify with a rich user community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my inicial search I came accross the following systems and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//sienci.com/product/sienci-mill-one-kit/"&gt;Sienci&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//diylilcnc.org/bigshoulders/"&gt;DiyLilcnc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//carbide3d.com/shapeoko/"&gt;Shapeoko&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/"&gt;X-Carve&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//openbuilds.com/?category=cartesian-style-cnc&amp;amp;id=287"&gt;Openbuild community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled across the &lt;a href="//www.maslowcnc.com/"&gt;Maslow&lt;/a&gt; and got really excited. The large format capabilities (4'x8') with the really low price ($350) would leave more than enough in my budget to buy two machines.  In fact, I may be able to buy a Maslow and then use it to make the parts I would need another project like the DiyLilcnc (Although I just realized the kickstart for that is relly old 2011).

On of the barriers for me getting back into blogging (besides my own personal hangups) is that I was never really satisified with either solution.  I wanted to "own" my blog information and didn't really feel comfortable with advertisers making money directly from my content (this is it's own argument).  Here are some criteria for what I was looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to edit/ add new content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily backed up to my own computer and ported to a different system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to modify and add my own tweaks/ features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses markdown or some similar text based file format to make it easy to use linux commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some digging and talking to people I decided that I wanted to try out a static website generation tool and the obvious one that seemed to fit my interests and criteria is Pelican and a git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Pelican was not as easy as I had hoped.  On two different occasions over the last couple of years I have made a deliberate effort to build a new website using Pelican.  It "worked" but there was some missing feature or bug that would get in my way actually making me adopt the format.  I also think that my reluctance to post things makes it harder for me to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as I write this blog post (in markdown) I do not actually have a blog to post it on.  My hope is that having some posts already waiting "in the hopper" will make my use of the software easier.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of one of my summer students, I am making an effort to try to come up with a useable version of a blog using Pelican.  My feeling is that active open source projects are constantly evolving and therefore getting better. Maybe third time is a charm?  If Pelican still does not work out I may need to explore a different platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I would like a workflow that not only works for my blog but also for some of other projects that need websites.  I also would like to try to make a kind of Pelican template repository that I can give to some of my peers and make it quick and easy for them to start their own website/blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blogging"></category><category term="Product Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Jupyter Accessability Project</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/jupyter-accessability-project.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-05-17:/jupyter-accessability-project.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My university (Michigan State University) plans to scale up the use of Jupyter in our classrooms but we need to address accessibility issues before we can adopt the platform for wide scale use.  On behalf of MSU I had an external group conduct a preliminary audit of our current jupyterhub …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My university (Michigan State University) plans to scale up the use of Jupyter in our classrooms but we need to address accessibility issues before we can adopt the platform for wide scale use.  On behalf of MSU I had an external group conduct a preliminary audit of our current jupyterhub server.  Based on this audit we determined that finding ways to improve Jupyter for the following user communities would be a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who have some one of the more common types of colorblindness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who use screen readers to help with understanding (ex. Dyslexia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals with dexterity issues who cannot effectively use a mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For part of my Jupyter hub project I am going to try to address these issues.  My hope is that some people are already working on these issues and I can just integrate existing plugins or patches.  However, If these communities can not be found I will try to build one myself.  I am currently talking with leaders in the Jupyter community to see the best way to build such a community.

It turns out that the fans got disconnected. Once I fixed the problem my
printer is working better than ever. I was itching for something to print so I
came up with this simple spacer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image--470762115.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image--470762115.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed a motion sensor in my basement because the light switch is in an
inconvenient place and most of the time we go in this part of the basement my
hands seem to be full. The motion sensor fixes this problem and even found a
outlet plate on thingiverse that fit perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:457658"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:457658&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that the installed switch box is too small for the new
sensor and my printed play sticks out a good 15 mm from the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes with OpenScad and a two hour print later I have a nice looking
solution.&lt;/p&gt;

while printing and I could not get the filament to feed.  This had happened
once in the past when I tried using some really cheap filament but I am not
sure the real root of the problem this time.  In any case, I found using the
"atomic" method for getting a clean nozzle. This method is named after
MostlyAtomicBob who described the method for the first time in the following
post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://umforum.ultimaker.com/index.php?/topic/3561-ultimaker-2-extruder-
nozzle-blocked/#entry28940&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of the steps that I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Remove the boden tube from the printer head&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Heat up the head to full temperature (around 210 degrees)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Push in a piece of spare filament until I can no longer push or it starts
coming out the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Reduce temperature to around 90 degrees. Filament should solidify but stay
a little soft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Pull the filament out of the print head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) Repeat steps 2-5 until I get completely clean filament&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the result of my cleaning in the picture below. The pieces are a
little backward and ordered from right to left.  Note the really dark char
slowly going away and the pieces getting longer as they nest better and better
in the print head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/IMG_2048.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/IMG_2048.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the same procedure when it clogged a second time. This time I
remembered to order them from left to right.  &lt;/p&gt;

volunteered to lead a couple of their meetings with a maker theme.  I thought
the 3D printer is always a hit and what better project for girl scouts than
cookies (yes I realize this is cliche but it is still fun).  I did some
searching on the internet and came up with a variety of ways the girl scouts
could design cookie cutters.  However, I had a checklist of desires and none
of them quite made the "cut" (I will stop now).  Here is what I was looking
for:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An option to upload and trace a picture. This is necessary because I do not have enough computers for the group. I saw a similar activity at the Detroit Maker Faire and I thought hand drawn images would be more natural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to add both internal and external features on the cookies. What I would really like is two layers so the cutters could imprint on the cookie as well as cut through the cookie. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally an online app so I do not have to download anything.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously an easy way to output stl files I could use with my printer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CookieCaster:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cookiecaster.com/#editor"&gt;http://www.cookiecaster.com/#editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Online app for drawing outline of cookie cutters.  This makes for a fun group
project because you can scan and upload hand drawings into the editor and
trace them.  The downside is that this editor only does a cookie outline and
not the insides. Here is an example we did:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/CookieCaster_screen.tiff"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/CookieCaster_screen.tiff"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cookie Cutter Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.local-guru.net/blog/pages/cookiecutter-editor"&gt;http://www.local-guru.net/blog/pages/cookiecutter-editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Downloadable cookie cutter editor. Uses a programming language called
processing (written in java).  I could not get the MacOS stand alone version
to work so I tried to download processing and run the source directly.  Still
was missing some libraries so I gave up on it.  Looking at the examples I do
not think it would work much better than CookieCaster and could not get any of
the internal details I wanted anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thingiverse:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=116042&amp;amp;code=2633da7762519236fd52412f6c8bf143"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=116042&amp;amp;code=2633da7762519236fd52412f6c8bf143&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thingiverse has one of their customizable apps.  This one was really nice
because it could do some internal details. Seems to only have one height but
having details is better than the other two.  However, this app also only had
an option for online editing and no way to upload a picture.  It was also a
difficult interface to master.  For example, it does not handle overlapping
editing very well and was particularly hard to get right with my laptop's
touchpad.  Here is an examples we made:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=116042"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=116042&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although none of the apps seem like they would work, none of them really fit
all of my criteria.  I am going to have the girl scouts use Cookie Caster
since it is the one that works with pictures. Please stay tuned for future
blog posts with details highlights from the girl scout projects.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this was the first time I saw a lithophane.  It was a picture of
Marilyn Monroe that just popped out if you held it so up to a light so that it
is backlit.  It was just so cool that I really wanted to make some Lithophanes
when I got my 3D printer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I finally found some time I did some research and there were a few
programs on the web which would make lithophanes for me.  &lt;/p&gt;

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a few but nothing excited me so I just wrote one myself.   I am very
pleased with the results:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have a printer I am happy to send you the MATLAB code to
generate these for yourself.  However, I must warn you that it is not very
robust and I am reluctant to post it until I can add a bunch of error checking
and a little better user interface.  It's also written in MATLAB, ideally I
would like to change to something like Python but I am just quicker working
with MATLAB.&lt;/p&gt;

to people with the light coming from the front.  Most of the time they are
polite and say, "that's nice."  Then I have them hold the lithophane to let
the light come in from the back and the image pops out.  "Wow," "cool" they
say and the expressions on their faces are ones of awe and surprise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For christmas this year, my wife came up with the idea of putting a picture of
the kids inside of a lithophane inside of a 3D printed snowflake.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/il_570xN.688476899_eapl.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/il_570xN.688476899_eapl.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a while to figure out but got much easier when I found an openscad
program to generate snowflakes I found on Thingiverse:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked a random seed that fit well with my idea and then I tried importing
my the stl file from my lithophane program.  I could not quite git it to work.
So, instead I decided to make the print in two parts and glue them together. I
did some minor modifications to the openscad file add an area for the
lithophane, the hole for a ribbon and in latter modifications a way to add the
year:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/Snowflake.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/Snowflake.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the stl file for the frame on youmagine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youmagine.com/designs/snowflake-ornament-frame"&gt;https://www.youmagine.com/designs/snowflake-ornament-frame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just print the lithophane separate from the frame and it turns out quite
well.  Here is a video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to share any of the code or you can just upload a photo and order
one of these on our etsy store:  &lt;/p&gt;

day.  That should be fun.  &lt;/p&gt;

I used those plastic hooks with the special double sided tape that allows you
to remove the hooks without damaging the wall.  Unfortunate, the kids managed
to pull the hooks off taking some paint and drywall with them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway my plan was to print put some new hooks using my 3D printer.  I thought
this would be the "cheap" way to  go.  I let my imagination get away with me
and ended up with something a little more expensive but also something unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image--608522330.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image--608522330.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is quite simple and consists of two hooks I found on thingiverse; a
fish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:242736"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:242736&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a round hook or bubble:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52764"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52764&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall affect is a fish tank with a bunch of fish skeletons swimming
around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image-1257835475.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image-1257835475.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is a little odd bit visually appealing and has a ton of places for
the kids to hand stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

There is air conditioning and internet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am worried that the kids are spending too much time inside on the devices.
At some point yestuday I banned the devices and told my eldest to go out and
build a fort:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image-559300753.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image-559300753.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found some old ladders ready for the burn pile and built from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fort turned out really well.  It is surprisingly strong and all of the
kids are proud of what they built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then wrote a simple program to add the two images together using a weighted
sum.  This technique looked okay but I also wanted some noise.  I used the
matlab imnoise function to create some sparkles. Inicially just a few, grow to
a lot about halfway and then disparate as the people materialize.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is to get the speckles to only appear where there are people.  I
could have tried some clever image subtraction trick to find the region that
changed but it was just as quick for me to use GIMP to cut the people out and
make a simple flag array using the following Matlab code.  I had to also use
GIMP to paint over any white spots in the image. Fortunately for my image
there was very little white. I ended up with the following (I guess I could
also have just select the white and set everything else to black).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_flag.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_flag.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, potting All the components together and looping from 0 to 100 I was able
to create a directory of images that I wanted and stitched the images together
using ffmpeg.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it off,  I found a transporter like sound on the net and used my copy
of Camtacia (&lt;a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html"&gt;http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html&lt;/a&gt;)  to put the audio and
video together.&lt;br&gt;

I decided that this would be a great project for me to do with my kids.  Step
one was to find the parts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell phone motors (pack of 50). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batteries. Large pack ordered on amazon: &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B0043SAFK0"&gt;http://amzn.com/B0043SAFK0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double sided tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toothbrushes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the motors and batteries, the price per brushbot was getting
expensive.  So Instead of buying a bunch of toothbrushes I decided to see if I
could print the body instead.  I came across the following design on
thingiverse that did exactly what I wanted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:68968"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:68968&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up using only the "legs" and the body.  I also think it was also
better to assemble the body upside down. In any case, I was able to print out
these three parts and just let the kids assemble them using superglue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;!](../images/blogger-image--1230627461.jpg](./images/blogger-image--1230627461.jpg)](../images/blogger-image--1230627461.jpg!](../images/blogger-image--1230627461.jpg](./images/blogger-image-1497897705.jpg)](../images/blogger-image-1497897705.jpg)!](../images/blogger-image--1230627461.jpg](./images/blogger-image-1759121257.jpg)](../images/blogger-image-1759121257.jpg) and
remove the sticker cover on the motor to stick it to the "bug".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](../images/blogger-image--1230627461.jpg!](../images/blogger-image--1230627461.jpg](./images/blogger-image-1701867005.jpg)](../images/blogger-image-1701867005.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add small pieces of double sided tape and lay down one of the wires on the
tape. Then have the kids stick the battery on top of the tape and use a second
piece of tape to secure the top wire.&lt;/p&gt;

something to take home with them.  Special thanks to

&lt;p&gt;I decided that this would be a fun project for my 3D printer.  There are a lot
of drawer guides in thingiverse. I downloaded a few drawer guild stl files but
none of them really fit my dawers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250839"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250839&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39023"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up having to design my own using a pair of calipers and OpenScad.  I
think they turned out great:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/Drawer_guild.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/Drawer_guild.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image-543254614.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image-543254614.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also replaced 3 of the four drawer stops using another design developed in
OpenScad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/DrawerStop.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/DrawerStop.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image-1595648182.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image-1595648182.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the flat part was printed I put it in a warm pan on the stove to soften
the plastic a little so I could put an appropriate bend in it. Here is a link
to my files if you are interested in working with them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/colbrydi/3D-Drawer"&gt;https://github.com/colbrydi/3D-Drawer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also posted them on YouMagine.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youmagine.com/designs/coffee-table-drawer-guild-and-stopper"&gt;https://www.youmagine.com/designs/coffee-table-drawer-guild-and-stopper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am happy with the results.  And I am comforted in knowing that I
can replace the parts again if the kids get destructive again.&lt;/p&gt;

Wonders" by &lt;a href="http://2014.cokesburyvbs.com/"&gt;Cokesbury&lt;/a&gt;.  I participate every
year with my kids but was extremely enthusiastic that the theme this year was
for makers so my goal is to show off the 3D printer and make some things for
the 50 or so kid participants.  It's no fun watching a 3D printer without
having something to touch and even take home.  However, I am fairly new to 3D
print design so this was only my second endeavor to design something of my
own.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to think of a project where each student would get a gismo to
take home but we could put them all together to build something as a group.
This fit in with the theme quite nicely however most of my ideas were a little
too complex to get off the ground.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally settled on building gears with logos and holes on one end so they
could attach them to their backpacks.  I thought I could assemble all of the
gears together to make one big machine the kids could play with that all
worked together.  With this plan in mind I searched though thingiverse and
youmagin for some designs I could use as a starting point.  I was really
excited when I found this one by &lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40410"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40410&lt;/a&gt; that
can be used to make gears that fit into Lego technics. I have a ton of lego
technics and I really liked the idea that the motivated students to integrate
their gear with their own legos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image--1703746521.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image--1703746521.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some iteration, I ultimately ended up doing is importing the images into
Inkscape and converting them to a dfx file which is a vector map using
instructions I found on a couple of website. Here is an example image I loaded
into Inkscape  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/icer.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/icer.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="../images/example-dfx-gear.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/example-dfx-gear.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this technique I was able to make a variety of gears and they worked
well with lego. Here is a video of one of the gears working with my old first
generation mindstorm:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a really flexible design and I was also able to someone
elses openscad files to make other gears with different projects I found on
thingiverse. For example here is one with a robot in a openscad file from
thingiverse &lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53285"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53285&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/example-scad-include-gear.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/example-scad-include-gear.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another one from an stl file I found on youmagin that originally was a
keychain modification for the ultimaker
(&lt;a href="https://www.youmagine.com/designs/ultimaker-key-fob-flat"&gt;https://www.youmagine.com/designs/ultimaker-key-fob-flat&lt;/a&gt;):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/example-stl-import-gear.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/example-stl-import-gear.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this design because it is easy for me to swap out different
logos based on the event.  I uploaded my source files and these examples to

&lt;p&gt;Easy way to entertain a fidgety girl on a beautiful but cold afternoon.  The
seeds ended up on the ground although I don't ever think I saw a bird.  &lt;/p&gt;

right size.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I took some measurements and came up with this drawing  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/quickreleasemount.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/quickreleasemount.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to see if I can print this out using a 3D printer. When I started
this project I was planning to use the one in the engineering department where
I work, but now I have an Ultimaker 2.  I know I need an stl file but I was
not sure the best way to generate one. After some quick internet searching I
found openscad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.openscad.org/"&gt;http://www.openscad.org/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the software and found the wiki quick start page.  It did not
take long to figure out the simple language.  I started by making a cube and
then creating the top.  Then I made objects to cut out the inside and the
bevels.  Here is the resulting model.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/QuickRelease.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/QuickRelease.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="./images/QuickRelease2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/QuickRelease2.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part was to get the surface normals for the wedge shape object to
face in the right direction.  However, once I drew out my points and used the
right hand rule things settled in nicely.  Openscad outputs stl files so all I
did was import it into the cura program to generate the gcode for my printer
and save it to the SD card to print.  The first print was a little too close
to my tolerances and I could not get it to fit inside the tripod.  However,
with some simple modifications to the openscad file I was able to generate a
quick release mount that I think looks quite nice and works well:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image-138421032.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image-138421032.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future design would fix the bottom to the mount somehow. I posted the STL
and OpenScad files on YouMagin.org if you are interested in makeing your own:  &lt;/p&gt;

maker. I really like the episodes where he tries to build things.  In most
cases he doesn't get his design right and has to debug and iterate on the
design until he has what he wants. It is a very good lesson for our young
makers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one episode George decides to make a pinata.  My youngest daughter LOVEs
this episode and has been asking my wife and I to make a pinata for weeks.  A
few weeks ago my wife relented and found a really nice youtube tutorial on-
line:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the supplies suggested by the video and my wife and kids started paper
machine a star shaped balloon and party hats.  The family ended up making two
since the overall costs were about the same.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We filled them with candy and put one of them to the test this weekend at a
family party:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image--2094275764.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image--2094275764.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem we had was keeping the pinata attached to the string.
Ultimately, I had to tie the string around the whole thing to get it to stay.
I probably need to follow George's example by iterating and engineering a
better process for the second one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this idea from a community garden just down the road.  They used an old
glass door as a small green house.  I am using the same idea but as a
screened-in space for a little garden.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the door from our local Habitat resale store and it works great.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the final product. Note, that the door opens for easy top
access and the back can be easily removed also by lifting it off the screws I
use as hooks.  &lt;/p&gt;

only purchased it for me, but she got what I consider to be one of the top of
the line hobby printers: the Ultimaker 2 (&lt;a href="https://www.ultimaker.com/"&gt;https://www.ultimaker.com/&lt;/a&gt;).  I
think one of the things that finally convinced her is when she started
checking out thingiverse and found stuff she wanted me to print.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only had it for about three days, but I can truly say that the
Ultimaker 2 is a joy to work with. Although expensive, it came fully assembled
and I had it out of the box and making my first print in less than an hour.
It has been printing almost non-stop since then.  I have made over 24 prints
and the thing keeps running: puddle jumper, toy daleks, keychains, hooks, 3d
puzzles, all kinds of stuff. Here are a few pictures:  &lt;/p&gt;

of mine since I was my daughter's age. I remember one vacation in Lake
Michigan with my family: my Aunt Pat gave me a 110 cartridge camera and
basically just let me loose. I was hooked. The only problem with my habit was
the cost of developing film, which I tried to pay for in high school by
working at a one hour developing store and in college by working on the
newspaper and yearbook. Finally, even though the resolution was poor, digital
cameras allowed me to feed my habit - and as they continuously get better I
haven't looked back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the plans for this light box on the internet (&lt;a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-make-a-inexpensive-light-tent"&gt;http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-make-a-inexpensive-light-tent&lt;/a&gt;) and thought it
would make a good project for me and my kids. A light box will also come in
handy if we need to take pictures of the things we are making.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to measure and cut the box. This is where we got stuck
because the cardboard paper I had was a little old and yellowish. I wanted
something cleaner so I had to set this project aside until I could by some
better cardboard (and cloth, while I was at it).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_LIght1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_LIght1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up buying Bristol board as recommend in the blog post. It has a nice
smooth finish and I think it will work well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Light2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Light2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter and I cut out strips of the board and glued them to the box.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Light3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Light3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once glued, we added the cloth and tested it out on my android phone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Light4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Light4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks okay, although I think I need some better (and brighter) lights -
but this looks to be a good start.  &lt;/p&gt;

where the university can recycle and reuse some of its vast equipment and
supplies. It turns out to be a big junk store. My goal was to find something
useful that I could take apart with my kids; I came across this $3 drill that
someone had already modified. You can tell by the after market trigger switch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Drill1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Drill1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughters and I took this drill apart to see how it works. The girls loved
the activity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Drill2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Drill2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Drill3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Drill3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had some trouble getting the chuck off, but overall it was a great way to
spend an hour on Saturday. I was just going to throw away the drill, but I
think the motor and gearbox may come in handy for a future project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Drill4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Drill4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of reverse making. This is an activity well-suited for younger
kids. I plan to hit the garage sales this summer looking for things we can
take apart and recycle or reuse for parts. Maybe we will build a robot!&lt;/p&gt;
