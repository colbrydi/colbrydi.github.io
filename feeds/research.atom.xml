&lt;p&gt;I gave an autobiographical talk today to the &lt;a href="//www.egr.msu.edu/graduate/ensure"&gt;EnSURE&lt;/a&gt; (Engineering Summer Undergraduate Research Experience) students. I have given this talk a few times and it is noticeably different that most of my presentations because the EnSURE organizers asked me to talk about myself and how I got where I am (instead of research or teaching).  The first time I gave this talk it was really awkward.  However, now I think it is kind of fun to tell stories about the choices I made throughout school and my carrier.  I get a lot of questions when I am done so I like to think the student's enjoyed the talk as well.  Here are a copy of my slides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons relearned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Commit early and Often&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be respectful of &lt;code&gt;rm -rf *&lt;/code&gt; especially when it is in a &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I learned this technique from Dr. Brian O'Shea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Michigan State University (MSU) my official title is curriculum specialist.  I have the unique opportunity to help develop entirely new courses for a brand new department (Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering CMSE, EST 2015).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague (Dr. Brian O'Shea) showed me a nice trick to organize my semester and brainstorm ideas to do a better job with backward design and matching up my lessons to my learning goals.  I make a grid of 3 rows with 5 columns on a whiteboard.  Each box represents one week of the semester (15 total).  I then use post-it notes to write down ideas and place them on the board.  This is a brainstorming stage where all ideas are equal.  If I do this early enough I can leave the board up and move the sticky notes around as I think about my learning goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MarkerBoard Grid" src="./Images/markdown-img-paste-20180610141148377.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently moved away from the whiteboard and use a blank wall in my office. I created the grid with painters tape. This leaves my whiteboard open for other ideas and lets me put up a board really early. For example, it is June and I have a board up for my Spring Course on Parallel programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Painters Tape Wall" src="./Images/markdown-img-paste-20180610140831494.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have been desinging many courses I may just leave the painters tape up.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>Inverse Problems Seminar</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/inverse-problems-seminar.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-06-04:/inverse-problems-seminar.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was invited to give a talk at the inverse seminars symposium:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//inverseproblems2018.org/"&gt;https://inverseproblems2018.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I was a little nervous since I don't consider myself an expert in inverse problems so I did not fully understand what they wanted me to present. However after talking to the organizers (Kirk and James), I discovered what they wanted was a high level talk and overview of advanced computing. This was something I could do! I put together snippets from a variety of my previous talks. Here is a link to the slides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./Images/20180604-InverseProblems.pdf"&gt;20180604-InverseProblems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I planned for a 60 minute talk but only ended up with 45 minutes (at most) of content. Luckly for me the organizers only really wanted a 30 Minutes talk and in the end I was relaxed and able to get though my slides at a reasonable pace in 20 minutes which led to 10 minutes of questions which turned out to be perfect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the Inverse Problems Symposium was a great event and I learned a lot. I was honored to be invited to give a talk. I was even considering attending next year at Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who have some one of the more common types of colorblindness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who use screen readers to help with understanding (ex. Dyslexia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals with dexterity issues who cannot effectively use a mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For part of my Jupyter hub project I am going to try to address these issues.  My hope is that some people are already working on these issues and I can just integrate existing plugins or patches.  However, If these communities can not be found I will try to build one myself.  I am currently talking with leaders in the Jupyter community to see the best way to build such a community.  Feel free to send me an email (colbrydi@msu.edu) and I would be happy to include you in on the conversation once I figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jupyter"></category><category term="Accessibility"></category></entry><entry><title>ACI-REF Talk</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/aci-ref-talk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2017-08-02:/aci-ref-talk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Research and Education Facilitator (ACI-REF) Virtual Residency workshop 2017 is intended for individuals who are responsible for helping researchers with computational and data-intensive research how to be more effective at demonstrating how to use cyberinfrastructure resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an amazing resource for CI Facilitators trying to get a start on their campus and there were many talks/activities I fould related closely to the CyberAmbassador program.  In particular I found the following to be related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="//www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_effectivecommunication_neeman_20170731.pdf"&gt;Effective Communication: How to Talk to Researchers about Their Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="//www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_ciusersupport_colbry_20170803.pdf"&gt;Cyberinfrastructure User Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the week Henry also had lots of small useful communication tidbits and we had an amazing Ad-hoc talk about how to communicate effectively using email.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, just before attending the CyberAmbassador grant was funded.  I managed to talk to the ACI-REF organizers (Henry Neman and Dana Brunson) about the grant and they found time in the schedule to let me talk to the audience.  Here is a link to my CyberAmbassador slides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="//www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_cyberambassadors_colbry_20170802.pdf"&gt;CyberAmbassador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk turned out to be great.  78&lt;strong&gt;+40&lt;/strong&gt; people were at the conference with &lt;strong&gt;40&lt;/strong&gt; in person and 78 calling in remotely. There seemed to be a lot of enthusiasm for the program  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentations"></category><category term="CyberAmbassador"></category></entry></feed>
