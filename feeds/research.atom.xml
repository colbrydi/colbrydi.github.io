&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who have some one of the more common types of colorblindness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who use screen readers to help with understanding (ex. Dyslexia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals with dexterity issues who cannot effectively use a mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For part of my Jupyter hub project I am going to try to address these issues.  My hope is that some people are already working on these issues and I can just integrate existing plugins or patches.  However, If these communities can not be found I will try to build one myself.  I am currently talking with leaders in the Jupyter community to see the best way to build such a community.  Feel free to send me an email (colbrydi@msu.edu) and I would be happy to include you in on the conversation once I figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jupyter"></category><category term="Accessibility"></category></entry><entry><title>ACI-REF Talk</title><link href="/aci-ref-talk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-08-02:/aci-ref-talk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Research and Education Facilitator (ACI-REF) Virtual Residency workshop 2017 is intended for individuals who are responsible for helping researchers with computational and data-intensive research how to be more effective at demonstrating how to use cyberinfrastructure resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an amazing resource for CI Facilitators trying to get a start on their campus and there were many talks/activities I fould related closely to the CyberAmbassador program.  In particular I found the following to be related:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_effectivecommunication_neeman_20170731.pdf"&gt;Effective Communication: How to Talk to Researchers about Their Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_effectivecommunication_neeman_20170731.pdf"&gt;How to Do an Intake Interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_ciusersupport_colbry_20170803.pdf"&gt;Cyberinfrastructure User Support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the week Henry also had lots of small useful communication tidbits and we had an amazing Ad-hoc talk about how to communicate effectively using email.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, just before attending the CyberAmbassador grant was funded.  I managed to talk to the ACI-REF organizers (Henry Neman and Dana Brunson) about the grant and they found time in the schedule to let me talk to the audience.  Here is a link to my CyberAmbassador slides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2017_talk_cyberambassadors_colbry_20170802.pdf"&gt;CyberAmbassador&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk turned out to be great.  78&lt;strong&gt;+40&lt;/strong&gt; people were at the conference with &lt;strong&gt;40&lt;/strong&gt; in person and 78 calling in remotely. There seemed to be a lot of enthusiasm for the program  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Presentation"></category><category term="CyberAmbassador"></category></entry></feed>
