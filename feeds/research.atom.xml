&lt;p&gt;These instructions are for installing RStudio on the HPCC. RStudio provides a variety of installers on their website &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/"&gt;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;These instructions are for installing RStudio on the HPCC. RStudio provides a variety of installers on their website &lt;a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/"&gt;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/&lt;/a&gt;. However, the HPCC uses an older version of Linux and the precompiled binaries are not compatible.  Trying to install RStudio from the source code is an option but is also difficult due to the large numbers of libraries and compile dependancies.  I basically gave up trying to install RStudio on until I realized that a version is included as an option in Anaconda.  The following instructions show how to install RStudio using Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 0:&lt;/strong&gt; Connect to the HPC.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use ssh to connect to the HPCC and make sure you have a working X11 server (ex. MobaXterm on windows or XQuarts on Mac).  More information about X11 can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="//wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Installing+an+X-server+on+Windows"&gt;Old HPCC Windows instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/hpccdocs/Installing+an+X-server++for+Macs"&gt;Old HPCC Mac Instructions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Download the Linux Anaconda installers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the latest Linux installer on the &lt;a href="//www.anaconda.com/download/#linux"&gt;Anaconda website&lt;/a&gt;. Right click on the download button for version 3.x and select "Copy Link". Use the &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; command on the hpcc to download the script file by typing wget and then pasting the url. For Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Install anaconda using the defaults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the downloaded script in bash using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;bash ./Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The last question will ask you to add the anaconda folder to your bashrc file. Say yes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Install RStudio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the conda install command to install RStudio.  Note you may need to run &lt;code&gt;source ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; first to update your path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;conda install rstudio
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That should be it, RStudio is now installed in your home directory on the HPCC.  The only other thing you will need is a X11 server.  Assuming you have connected to the hpcc with an X11 connection you can run rstudio from the command line by typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;rstudio

This user is running a lot of jobs with 512 cores (current cpu limit is 520).  The problem is that it is really difficult for the user to estimate the walltimes. There is a 2x difference in walltimes on the HPCC.  The code has been tested on other large scale systems with much less variation. The user would prefer more consistent runtimes and did not mind waiting in the queue (although less queue time is better).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there are many things that can impact the runtime of a job. The HPCC runs at over 95% utilization most of the time so many of the resources are in contention.  Without additional information, my best guess is that the bottleneck is MPI communication over the high speed network. If this is the case, I hypothesize that moving more processes to the same nodes (instead of spread across the cluster) will help reduce network competition with other users and result in more consistent walltimes. Here are some things I suggested the user try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a ticket with iCER and see if you can set up a consulting appointment. They may be able to get much better idea about what resources are in contention and causing the bottleneck: &lt;a href="https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact"&gt;https://contact.icer.msu.edu/contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add “qstat -f ${PBS_JOBID}” to the end of the jobscript.  This will provide some stats that may help us understand differences between jobs that run fast and slow.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try different core and node ratios (ex. nodes=128:ppn=4, nodes=64:ppn=8, nodes=32:ppn=8 etc.). Although increasing the ppn will likely make queue times longer, i believe the overall runtime will be more consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the process to get DOE and XSEDE allocations.  Create XSEDE Portal account here: &lt;a href="https://portal.xsede.org/"&gt;https://portal.xsede.org/&lt;/a&gt; and send me your login name when you get it so we can add you to the MSU campus champion account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone else have a similar problem?  Other suggestions that I may have missed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave an autobiographical talk today to the &lt;a href="//www.egr.msu.edu/graduate/ensure"&gt;EnSURE&lt;/a&gt; (Engineering Summer Undergraduate Research Experience) students. I have given this talk a few times and it is noticeably different that most of my presentations because the EnSURE organizers asked me to talk about myself and how I got where I am (instead of research or teaching).  The first time I gave this talk it was really awkward.  However, now I think it is kind of fun to tell stories about the choices I made throughout school and my carrier.  I get a lot of questions when I am done so I like to think the student's enjoyed the talk as well.  Here are a copy of my slides:&lt;/p&gt;

I learned this technique from Dr. Brian O'Shea.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Michigan State University (MSU) my official title is curriculum specialist.  I have the unique opportunity to help develop entirely new courses for a brand new department (Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering CMSE, EST 2015).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague (Dr. Brian O'Shea) showed me a nice trick to organize my semester and brainstorm ideas to do a better job with backward design and matching up my lessons to my learning goals.  I make a grid of 3 rows with 5 columns on a whiteboard.  Each box represents one week of the semester (15 total).  I then use post-it notes to write down ideas and place them on the board.  This is a brainstorming stage where all ideas are equal.  If I do this early enough I can leave the board up and move the sticky notes around as I think about my learning goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MarkerBoard Grid" src="./Images/markdown-img-paste-20180610141148377.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently moved away from the whiteboard and use a blank wall in my office. I created the grid with painters tape. This leaves my whiteboard open for other ideas and lets me put up a board really early. For example, it is June and I have a board up for my Spring Course on Parallel programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Painters Tape Wall" src="./Images/markdown-img-paste-20180610140831494.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first I was a little nervous since I don't consider myself an expert in inverse problems so I did not fully understand what they wanted me to present. However after talking to the organizers (Kirk and James), I discovered what they wanted was a high level talk and overview of advanced computing. This was something I could do! I put together snippets from a variety of my previous talks. Here is a link to the slides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./Images/20180604-InverseProblems.pdf"&gt;20180604-InverseProblems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I planned for a 60 minute talk but only ended up with 45 minutes (at most) of content. Luckly for me the organizers only really wanted a 30 Minutes talk and in the end I was relaxed and able to get though my slides at a reasonable pace in 20 minutes which led to 10 minutes of questions which turned out to be perfect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the Inverse Problems Symposium was a great event and I learned a lot. I was honored to be invited to give a talk. I was even considering attending next year at Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who have some one of the more common types of colorblindness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals who use screen readers to help with understanding (ex. Dyslexia)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals with dexterity issues who cannot effectively use a mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For part of my Jupyter hub project I am going to try to address these issues.  My hope is that some people are already working on these issues and I can just integrate existing plugins or patches.  However, If these communities can not be found I will try to build one myself.  I am currently talking with leaders in the Jupyter community to see the best way to build such a community.  Feel free to send me an email (colbrydi@msu.edu) and I would be happy to include you in on the conversation once I figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Jupyter"></category><category term="Accessibility"></category></entry><entry><title>ACI-REF Talk</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/aci-ref-talk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2017-08-02:/aci-ref-talk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Research and Education Facilitator (ACI-REF) Virtual Residency workshop 2017 is intended for individuals who are responsible for helping researchers with computational and data-intensive research how to be more effective at demonstrating how to use cyberinfrastructure resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop is an amazing resource for CI Facilitators trying to get a start on their campus and there were many talks/activities I fould related closely to the CyberAmbassador program.  In particular I found the following to be related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the week Henry also had lots of small useful communication tidbits and we had an amazing Ad-hoc talk about how to communicate effectively using email.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, just before attending the CyberAmbassador grant was funded.  I managed to talk to the ACI-REF organizers (Henry Neman and Dana Brunson) about the grant and they found time in the schedule to let me talk to the audience.  Here is a link to my CyberAmbassador slides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk turned out to be great.  78&lt;strong&gt;+40&lt;/strong&gt; people were at the conference with &lt;strong&gt;40&lt;/strong&gt; in person and 78 calling in remotely.
