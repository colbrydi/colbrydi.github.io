of mine since I was my daughter's age. I remember one vacation in Lake
Michigan with my family: my Aunt Pat gave me a 110 cartridge camera and
basically just let me loose. I was hooked. The only problem with my habit was
the cost of developing film, which I tried to pay for in high school by
working at a one hour developing store and in college by working on the
newspaper and yearbook. Finally, even though the resolution was poor, digital
cameras allowed me to feed my habit - and as they continuously get better I
haven't looked back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the plans for this light box on the internet (&lt;a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-make-a-inexpensive-light-tent"&gt;http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-make-a-inexpensive-light-tent&lt;/a&gt;) and thought it
would make a good project for me and my kids. A light box will also come in
handy if we need to take pictures of the things we are making.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to measure and cut the box. This is where we got stuck
because the cardboard paper I had was a little old and yellowish. I wanted
something cleaner so I had to set this project aside until I could by some
better cardboard (and cloth, while I was at it).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_LIght1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_LIght1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up buying Bristol board as recommend in the blog post. It has a nice
smooth finish and I think it will work well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Light2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Light2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter and I cut out strips of the board and glued them to the box.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Light3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Light3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once glued, we added the cloth and tested it out on my android phone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Light4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Light4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks okay, although I think I need some better (and brighter) lights -
but this looks to be a good start.  &lt;/p&gt;
