&lt;p&gt;The company uses open source hardware so I guess I could try to build it on my own and save a little money. All of the tools are built using 3D Printing so there is that.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I stubbled across &lt;a href="//www.jjrobots.com/"&gt;JJRobots&lt;/a&gt; and I just love the idea of this company.  They sell a kit of electronic parts to maker hobbyists with access to 3D printers.   The idea is that you use your 3D printer to make the items and everything you can't print is in the kit provided by JJRobots.  They spend their time developing new products that you can print with the same kit.  For example, the kit I purchased can be used to build the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marker board writer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotic arm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motorized Camera slider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini Robotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Hocky Robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I have only built the Eggbot but it was awesome!  We spent last easter painting egg shells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;Pictures here&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that print was tricky and my printer has been on the fritz lately (see other posts) and I haven't had the time/space to fix it.  However, my family and I are moving to a bigger house with a dedicated maker space so I hope to start working on projects again.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maker"></category><category term="Product Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>CNC Mill Picking</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/cnc-mill-picking.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-05-18:/cnc-mill-picking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am interested in purchasing a CNC machine for the shop space in our new house.

I think I would like to stick to something around $1000 but would be willing to invest as much as $2000 if I can find the right machine.  There are a lot of choices in this price range for hobby CNC machines.  Some other selection criteria include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big cut area (I would love 4'x8' but that seems a lot) - I am interested in trying out thigns you can do with furniture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small detailed work - I also have a few small projects that require detail.  I realize it will be difficult to have a machine that does both big and small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source hardware (I just like these projects) - Something I can easily modify with a rich user community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my inicial search I came accross the following systems and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//sienci.com/product/sienci-mill-one-kit/"&gt;Sienci&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//diylilcnc.org/bigshoulders/"&gt;DiyLilcnc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//carbide3d.com/shapeoko/"&gt;Shapeoko&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/"&gt;X-Carve&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//openbuilds.com/?category=cartesian-style-cnc&amp;amp;id=287"&gt;Openbuild community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled across the &lt;a href="//www.maslowcnc.com/"&gt;Maslow&lt;/a&gt; and got really excited. The large format capabilities (4'x8') with the really low price ($350) would leave more than enough in my budget to buy two machines.  In fact, I may be able to buy a Maslow and then use it to make the parts I would need another project like the DiyLilcnc (Although I just realized the kickstart for that is relly old 2011).  There are probably other projects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maker"></category><category term="CNC"></category></entry><entry><title>Intrducing a 3D printer to my daughter's Kindergarten class</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/intrducing-a-3d-printer-to-my-daughters-kindergarten-class.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2015-05-09:/intrducing-a-3d-printer-to-my-daughters-kindergarten-class.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had fun showing off my 3D printer to the Kindergarten class.

I like to come up with classroom projects that let the kids use things that
are printed with the printer. Since it is so cheep it is also fun to print
something ahead of time that they can take home.  &lt;/p&gt;

put together a cut spring  time flower pots just in time for mother's day:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed a motion sensor in my basement because the light switch is in an
inconvenient place and most of the time we go in this part of the basement my
hands seem to be full. The motion sensor fixes this problem and even found a
outlet plate on thingiverse that fit perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that the installed switch box is too small for the new
sensor and my printed play sticks out a good 15 mm from the box.&lt;/p&gt;

while printing and I could not get the filament to feed.  This had happened
once in the past when I tried using some really cheap filament but I am not
sure the real root of the problem this time.  In any case, I found using the
"atomic" method for getting a clean nozzle. This method is named after
MostlyAtomicBob who described the method for the first time in the following
post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://umforum.ultimaker.com/index.php?/topic/3561-ultimaker-2-extruder-
nozzle-blocked/#entry28940&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of the steps that I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Remove the boden tube from the printer head&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Heat up the head to full temperature (around 210 degrees)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Push in a piece of spare filament until I can no longer push or it starts
coming out the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Reduce temperature to around 90 degrees. Filament should solidify but stay
a little soft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Pull the filament out of the print head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) Repeat steps 2-5 until I get completely clean filament&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the result of my cleaning in the picture below. The pieces are a
little backward and ordered from right to left.  Note the really dark char
slowly going away and the pieces getting longer as they nest better and better
in the print head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/IMG_2048.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/IMG_2048.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the same procedure when it clogged a second time. This time I
remembered to order them from left to right.  &lt;/p&gt;

volunteered to lead a couple of their meetings with a maker theme.  I thought
the 3D printer is always a hit and what better project for girl scouts than
cookies (yes I realize this is cliche but it is still fun).  I did some
searching on the internet and came up with a variety of ways the girl scouts
could design cookie cutters.  However, I had a checklist of desires and none
of them quite made the "cut" (I will stop now).  Here is what I was looking
for:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An option to upload and trace a picture. This is necessary because I do not have enough computers for the group. I saw a similar activity at the Detroit Maker Faire and I thought hand drawn images would be more natural.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to add both internal and external features on the cookies. What I would really like is two layers so the cutters could imprint on the cookie as well as cut through the cookie. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally an online app so I do not have to download anything.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously an easy way to output stl files I could use with my printer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CookieCaster:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cookiecaster.com/#editor"&gt;http://www.cookiecaster.com/#editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Online app for drawing outline of cookie cutters.  This makes for a fun group
project because you can scan and upload hand drawings into the editor and
trace them.  The downside is that this editor only does a cookie outline and
not the insides. Here is an example we did:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/CookieCaster_screen.tiff"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/CookieCaster_screen.tiff"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cookie Cutter Editor:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.local-guru.net/blog/pages/cookiecutter-editor"&gt;http://www.local-guru.net/blog/pages/cookiecutter-editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Downloadable cookie cutter editor. Uses a programming language called
processing (written in java).  I could not get the MacOS stand alone version
to work so I tried to download processing and run the source directly.  Still
was missing some libraries so I gave up on it.  Looking at the examples I do
not think it would work much better than CookieCaster and could not get any of
the internal details I wanted anyway.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thingiverse:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=116042&amp;amp;code=2633da7762519236fd52412f6c8bf143"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=116042&amp;amp;code=2633da7762519236fd52412f6c8bf143&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thingiverse has one of their customizable apps.  This one was really nice
because it could do some internal details. Seems to only have one height but
having details is better than the other two.  However, this app also only had
an option for online editing and no way to upload a picture.  It was also a
difficult interface to master.  For example, it does not handle overlapping
editing very well and was particularly hard to get right with my laptop's
touchpad.  Here is an examples we made:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=116042"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=116042&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although none of the apps seem like they would work, none of them really fit

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this was the first time I saw a lithophane.  It was a picture of
Marilyn Monroe that just popped out if you held it so up to a light so that it
is backlit.  It was just so cool that I really wanted to make some Lithophanes
when I got my 3D printer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I finally found some time I did some research and there were a few
programs on the web which would make lithophanes for me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://maker.dongguk.edu/webclient/cylinder_litho_index.html&lt;br&gt;
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a few but nothing excited me so I just wrote one myself.   I am very
pleased with the results:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/il_570xN.666710307_cq47.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/il_570xN.666710307_cq47.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just want a lithophane, we added them to my wife's etsy store:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/familyheART"&gt;https://www.etsy.com/shop/familyheART&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have a printer I am happy to send you the MATLAB code to
generate these for yourself.  However, I must warn you that it is not very
robust and I am reluctant to post it until I can add a bunch of error checking
and a little better user interface.  It's also written in MATLAB, ideally I
would like to change to something like Python but I am just quicker working
with MATLAB.&lt;/p&gt;

to people with the light coming from the front.  Most of the time they are
polite and say, "that's nice."  Then I have them hold the lithophane to let
the light come in from the back and the image pops out.  "Wow," "cool" they
say and the expressions on their faces are ones of awe and surprise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For christmas this year, my wife came up with the idea of putting a picture of
the kids inside of a lithophane inside of a 3D printed snowflake.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/il_570xN.688476899_eapl.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/il_570xN.688476899_eapl.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Took a while to figure out but got much easier when I found an openscad
program to generate snowflakes I found on Thingiverse:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked a random seed that fit well with my idea and then I tried importing
my the stl file from my lithophane program.  I could not quite git it to work.
So, instead I decided to make the print in two parts and glue them together. I
did some minor modifications to the openscad file add an area for the
lithophane, the hole for a ribbon and in latter modifications a way to add the
year:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/Snowflake.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/Snowflake.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the stl file for the frame on youmagine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youmagine.com/designs/snowflake-ornament-frame"&gt;https://www.youmagine.com/designs/snowflake-ornament-frame&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I just print the lithophane separate from the frame and it turns out quite
well.  Here is a video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to share any of the code or you can just upload a photo and order
one of these on our etsy store:  &lt;/p&gt;

day.  That should be fun.  &lt;/p&gt;

I used those plastic hooks with the special double sided tape that allows you
to remove the hooks without damaging the wall.  Unfortunate, the kids managed
to pull the hooks off taking some paint and drywall with them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway my plan was to print put some new hooks using my 3D printer.  I thought
this would be the "cheap" way to  go.  I let my imagination get away with me
and ended up with something a little more expensive but also something unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image--608522330.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image--608522330.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is quite simple and consists of two hooks I found on thingiverse; a
fish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:242736"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:242736&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a round hook or bubble:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52764"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:52764&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall affect is a fish tank with a bunch of fish skeletons swimming
around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design is a little odd bit visually appealing and has a ton of places for
the kids to hand stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am worried that the kids are spending too much time inside on the devices.
At some point yestuday I banned the devices and told my eldest to go out and
build a fort:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then wrote a simple program to add the two images together using a weighted
sum.  This technique looked okay but I also wanted some noise.  I used the
matlab imnoise function to create some sparkles. Inicially just a few, grow to
a lot about halfway and then disparate as the people materialize.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is to get the speckles to only appear where there are people.  I
could have tried some clever image subtraction trick to find the region that
changed but it was just as quick for me to use GIMP to cut the people out and
make a simple flag array using the following Matlab code.  I had to also use
GIMP to paint over any white spots in the image. Fortunately for my image
there was very little white. I ended up with the following (I guess I could
also have just select the white and set everything else to black).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_flag.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_flag.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, potting All the components together and looping from 0 to 100 I was able
to create a directory of images that I wanted and stitched the images together
using ffmpeg.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it off,  I found a transporter like sound on the net and used my copy
of Camtacia (&lt;a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html"&gt;http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html&lt;/a&gt;)  to put the audio and
video together.&lt;br&gt;

I decided that this would be a great project for me to do with my kids.  Step
one was to find the parts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell phone motors (pack of 50). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batteries. Large pack ordered on amazon: &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/B0043SAFK0"&gt;http://amzn.com/B0043SAFK0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double sided tape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toothbrushes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the motors and batteries, the price per brushbot was getting
expensive.  So Instead of buying a bunch of toothbrushes I decided to see if I
could print the body instead.  I came across the following design on
thingiverse that did exactly what I wanted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:68968"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:68968&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up using only the "legs" and the body.  I also think it was also
better to assemble the body upside down. In any case, I was able to print out
these three parts and just let the kids assemble them using superglue:&lt;/p&gt;

tape. Then have the kids stick the battery on top of the tape and use a second
piece of tape to secure the top wire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided that this would be a fun project for my 3D printer.  There are a lot
of drawer guides in thingiverse. I downloaded a few drawer guild stl files but
none of them really fit my dawers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250839"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250839&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39023"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up having to design my own using a pair of calipers and OpenScad.  I
think they turned out great:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/Drawer_guild.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/Drawer_guild.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image-543254614.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image-543254614.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also replaced 3 of the four drawer stops using another design developed in
OpenScad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/DrawerStop.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/DrawerStop.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image-1595648182.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image-1595648182.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the flat part was printed I put it in a warm pan on the stove to soften
the plastic a little so I could put an appropriate bend in it. Here is a link
to my files if you are interested in working with them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/colbrydi/3D-Drawer"&gt;https://github.com/colbrydi/3D-Drawer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also posted them on YouMagine.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youmagine.com/designs/coffee-table-drawer-guild-and-stopper"&gt;https://www.youmagine.com/designs/coffee-table-drawer-guild-and-stopper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am happy with the results.  And I am comforted in knowing that I
can replace the parts again if the kids get destructive again.&lt;/p&gt;

Wonders" by &lt;a href="http://2014.cokesburyvbs.com/"&gt;Cokesbury&lt;/a&gt;.  I participate every
year with my kids but was extremely enthusiastic that the theme this year was
for makers so my goal is to show off the 3D printer and make some things for
the 50 or so kid participants.  It's no fun watching a 3D printer without
having something to touch and even take home.  However, I am fairly new to 3D
print design so this was only my second endeavor to design something of my
own.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to think of a project where each student would get a gismo to
take home but we could put them all together to build something as a group.
This fit in with the theme quite nicely however most of my ideas were a little
too complex to get off the ground.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally settled on building gears with logos and holes on one end so they
could attach them to their backpacks.  I thought I could assemble all of the
gears together to make one big machine the kids could play with that all
worked together.  With this plan in mind I searched though thingiverse and
youmagin for some designs I could use as a starting point.  I was really
excited when I found this one by &lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40410"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40410&lt;/a&gt; that
can be used to make gears that fit into Lego technics. I have a ton of lego
technics and I really liked the idea that the motivated students to integrate
their gear with their own legos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image--1703746521.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image--1703746521.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some iteration, I ultimately ended up doing is importing the images into
Inkscape and converting them to a dfx file which is a vector map using
instructions I found on a couple of website. Here is an example image I loaded
into Inkscape  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/icer.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/icer.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="../images/example-dfx-gear.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/example-dfx-gear.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this technique I was able to make a variety of gears and they worked
well with lego. Here is a video of one of the gears working with my old first
generation mindstorm:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a really flexible design and I was also able to someone
elses openscad files to make other gears with different projects I found on
thingiverse. For example here is one with a robot in a openscad file from
thingiverse &lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53285"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53285&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/example-scad-include-gear.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/example-scad-include-gear.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another one from an stl file I found on youmagin that originally was a
keychain modification for the ultimaker
(&lt;a href="https://www.youmagine.com/designs/ultimaker-key-fob-flat"&gt;https://www.youmagine.com/designs/ultimaker-key-fob-flat&lt;/a&gt;):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/example-stl-import-gear.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/example-stl-import-gear.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this design because it is easy for me to swap out different
logos based on the event.  I uploaded my source files and these examples to
github:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/colbrydi/gear-givaways"&gt;https://github.com/colbrydi/gear-givaways&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And posted a few on Youmagine.org  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youmagine.com/designs/gear-givaways"&gt;https://www.youmagine.com/designs/gear-givaways&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you find this helpful and email me links to gears that
you have made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I took some measurements and came up with this drawing  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/quickreleasemount.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/quickreleasemount.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to see if I can print this out using a 3D printer. When I started
this project I was planning to use the one in the engineering department where
I work, but now I have an Ultimaker 2.  I know I need an stl file but I was
not sure the best way to generate one. After some quick internet searching I
found openscad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.openscad.org/"&gt;http://www.openscad.org/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the software and found the wiki quick start page.  It did not
take long to figure out the simple language.  I started by making a cube and
then creating the top.  Then I made objects to cut out the inside and the
bevels.  Here is the resulting model.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/QuickRelease.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/QuickRelease.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="./images/QuickRelease2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/QuickRelease2.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part was to get the surface normals for the wedge shape object to
face in the right direction.  However, once I drew out my points and used the
right hand rule things settled in nicely.  Openscad outputs stl files so all I
did was import it into the cura program to generate the gcode for my printer
and save it to the SD card to print.  The first print was a little too close
to my tolerances and I could not get it to fit inside the tripod.  However,
with some simple modifications to the openscad file I was able to generate a
quick release mount that I think looks quite nice and works well:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image-138421032.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image-138421032.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A future design would fix the bottom to the mount somehow. I posted the STL
and OpenScad files on YouMagin.org if you are interested in makeing your own:  &lt;/p&gt;

maker. I really like the episodes where he tries to build things.  In most
cases he doesn't get his design right and has to debug and iterate on the
design until he has what he wants. It is a very good lesson for our young
makers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one episode George decides to make a pinata.  My youngest daughter LOVEs
this episode and has been asking my wife and I to make a pinata for weeks.  A
few weeks ago my wife relented and found a really nice youtube tutorial on-
line:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the supplies suggested by the video and my wife and kids started paper
machine a star shaped balloon and party hats.  The family ended up making two
since the overall costs were about the same.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We filled them with candy and put one of them to the test this weekend at a
family party:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="../images/blogger-image--2094275764.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/blogger-image--2094275764.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem we had was keeping the pinata attached to the string.
Ultimately, I had to tie the string around the whole thing to get it to stay.
I probably need to follow George's example by iterating and engineering a
better process for the second one.  &lt;/p&gt;

hoped: there were plenty of robots, 3d manufacturing devices and other things
to touch and play with.  My oldest daughter (with help from her papa) even got
to do her first soldering using one of the "learn to solder badges" from the
maker shed
(&lt;a href="http://www.makershed.com/Learn_to_Solder_Skill_Badge_Kit_p/mkls01.htm"&gt;http://www.makershed.com/Learn_to_Solder_Skill_Badge_Kit_p/mkls01.htm&lt;/a&gt;). I
heard a lot about this kit and it was better than I thought it would be:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_DSC_6122.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_DSC_6122.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the size and the enthusiasm at the event and am looking forward
to the Detroit Maker Faire.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_DSC_6128.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_DSC_6128.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_DSC_6131.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_DSC_6131.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't wait until the next one.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this idea from a community garden just down the road.  They used an old
glass door as a small green house.  I am using the same idea but as a
screened-in space for a little garden.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the door from our local Habitat resale store and it works great.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the final product. Note, that the door opens for easy top
access and the back can be easily removed also by lifting it off the screws I
use as hooks.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years my wife has listened to me think about buying or building a 3D
printer.  At heart I am a cheapskate and can not justify spending a lot of
money on a toy.  I even had a &lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/"&gt;http://www.thingiverse.com/&lt;/a&gt; account and would
spend time "liking" things I would print if I only had the
printer...](../images/blogger-image-593926156.jpg](./images/blogger-image-593926156.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think my wife got sick of me talking about getting a printer. She not
only purchased it for me, but she got what I consider to be one of the top of
the line hobby printers: the Ultimaker 2 (&lt;a href="https://www.ultimaker.com/"&gt;https://www.ultimaker.com/&lt;/a&gt;).  I
think one of the things that finally convinced her is when she started
checking out thingiverse and found stuff she wanted me to print.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only had it for about three days, but I can truly say that the
Ultimaker 2 is a joy to work with. Although expensive, it came fully assembled
and I had it out of the box and making my first print in less than an hour.
It has been printing almost non-stop since then.  I have made over 24 prints
and the thing keeps running: puddle jumper, toy daleks, keychains, hooks, 3d
puzzles, all kinds of stuff. Here are a few pictures:  &lt;/p&gt;

where the university can recycle and reuse some of its vast equipment and
supplies. It turns out to be a big junk store. My goal was to find something
useful that I could take apart with my kids; I came across this $3 drill that
someone had already modified. You can tell by the after market trigger switch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Drill1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Drill1.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughters and I took this drill apart to see how it works. The girls loved
the activity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Drill2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Drill2.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Drill3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Drill3.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had some trouble getting the chuck off, but overall it was a great way to
spend an hour on Saturday. I was just going to throw away the drill, but I
think the motor and gearbox may come in handy for a future project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="./images/small_Drill4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="./images/small_Drill4.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of reverse making. This is an activity well-suited for younger
kids. I plan to hit the garage sales this summer looking for things we can
take apart and recycle or reuse for parts. Maybe we will build a robot!&lt;/p&gt;
