Unfortunately, Twitter Feed is no longer around and their website recommended &lt;a href="//dlvr.it"&gt;dlvr.it&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far it was fairly strait forward to set up an account and I followed the menus to connect my &lt;a href="//docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; RSS feed to my &lt;a href="//twitter.com/colbrydi"&gt;Titter&lt;/a&gt; account. At first it didn't seem to do anything but then I noticed a message that said something like "Last checked 56 seconds ago" and I went back to my Twitter account and all of my blog posts had been tweeted.  Which is what I wanted so Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there were a lot of options that I didn't understand.  For example, I thought it would only tweet the latest blog post.  It didn't, it tweeted them all. Which is fine, this is where I wanted to go but I was hoping to test it first before blasting all of my twitter followers (I do not think I have many).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem was that it only tweeted the title and the URL which is not very detailed. I don't want to everyone to be required to go to my blog post.  I found an option to also include the body of the post.  We will see if that does anything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to use this post as a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a setting in dlvr.it that I turned on to "Post Body".  This let more come though the twitter feed and nicely includes an image.  This makes the behavior act as expected so I am really excited.  Oddly, this particular post is not seen on Twitter.  This is because I went over the 10 post limit on dlvr.it.   I am going to change the post date to today and see if that helps things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Changing the date in the post didn't seem to trigger dlvr.it to post this message on twitter. I am now changing the filename inside of pelican to see if that changes the RSS feed enough to make dlvr.it think this is a new post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Changing the pelican filename didn't do anything either. I looked though the RSS feed and now I think maybe changing the post title will make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blogging"></category><category term="Product Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Spark mail</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/spark-mail.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-06-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-06-06:/spark-mail.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img align="right" alt="Spark Logo" src="//sparkmailapp.com/img/spark2/common/spark.svg" width="20%,"&gt;

I am weird that I like email.  It is my preferred form of communication on projects (maybe I am just getting old).  I trust that I will get to my email and that I will not loose things.  I realize that this trust is often not true but it is true enough for me to keep productive. For the longest time Gmail was my favorite email application. However, work changed policy from "we highly recommend you don't use Gmail" to "don't use gmail".  So I chose to switch to the university Office 365 accounts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the built-in Mac mail program.  It didn't thread my email the way I prefer.  I also tried outlook which had its own problems.  I don't really feel like bashing this software, it just didn't work in a way that fit my Gmail workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I move into a new laptop I stubbled across the spark email client. About three weeks into using it I am very satisfied. The laptop and phone versions work nicely together. I really like having both my personal Gmail account and work accounts connected in one application.  There are a lot of things I like but probably the best is that since using Spark I have gotten my inbox to zero almost every day.  This is big news. I am a big fan of emptying my inbox but this is often a challenge.  I like the fact that Spark will allow me to show badges with the number of messages in my inbox instead of the number of unread messages.  For some reason this is a real motivator for getting my email where they need to be. It also helps me keep my Gmail clean which is mostly news feeds, advertisements, etc.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Product Reviews"></category><category term="Lifehacking"></category></entry><entry><title>FarmBot</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/farmbot.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-05-27:/farmbot.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been coveting a &lt;a href="//farm.bot/"&gt;FarmBot&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I stubbled across &lt;a href="//www.jjrobots.com/"&gt;JJRobots&lt;/a&gt; and I just love the idea of this company.  They sell a kit of electronic parts to maker hobbyists with access to 3D printers.   The idea is that you use your 3D printer to make the items and everything you can't print is in the kit provided by JJRobots.  They spend their time developing new products that you can print with the same kit.  For example, the kit I purchased can be used to build the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marker board writer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robotic arm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motorized Camera slider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mini Robotic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Air Hocky Robot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I have only built the Eggbot but it was awesome!  We spent last easter painting egg shells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;Pictures here&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately that print was tricky and my printer has been on the fritz lately (see other posts) and I haven't had the time/space to fix it.  However, my family and I are moving to a bigger house with a dedicated maker space so I hope to start working on projects again.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maker"></category><category term="Product Reviews"></category></entry><entry><title>Remember the Milk</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/remember-the-milk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-05-19:/remember-the-milk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been a paid subscriber and dedicated customer to Remember the Milk (RTM) for many years (I have lost count).

A few years ago I maintained a blog when I worked for the Institute for Cyber-Enabled Research (iCER) at Michigan State University (MSU). At iCER I did a lot of High Performance Computing (HPC) User support. This involved mostly helping researchers figure out how to use advanced computing systems in their research.  I got into a habit of writing up a blog post when I learned something new or figured out a solution to a practical technical problem.  I also found the blog useful for posting slides and examples from presentations I would often make at workshops and conferences. Many of these old posts are still see a little traffic. Check them out here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did some blogging related to my kids and our "maker" hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//apprenticemaker.blogspot.com/"&gt;Maker Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I moved away from working directly for iCER and have not done a good job keeping up with my maker blog. I am going to try to bring the blogging habit back into my workflow.   I am currently in the middle of quite a few projects relating to education and large scale computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of goals for writing a blog. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting over my reluctance to share and communicate in online communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping me organize and be accountable for my projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting with people with similar interests to my own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing informations that others may find helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach these goals I am going to try to get into a daily habit of writing.  I don't think I will post a blog everyday but the writing habit is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Lifehacking"></category></entry><entry><title>CNC Mill Picking</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/cnc-mill-picking.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-05-18:/cnc-mill-picking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am interested in purchasing a CNC machine for the shop space in our new house.

I think I would like to stick to something around $1000 but would be willing to invest as much as $2000 if I can find the right machine.  There are a lot of choices in this price range for hobby CNC machines.  Some other selection criteria include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big cut area (I would love 4'x8' but that seems a lot) - I am interested in trying out thigns you can do with furniture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small detailed work - I also have a few small projects that require detail.  I realize it will be difficult to have a machine that does both big and small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source hardware (I just like these projects) - Something I can easily modify with a rich user community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my inicial search I came accross the following systems and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="//sienci.com/product/sienci-mill-one-kit/"&gt;Sienci&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//diylilcnc.org/bigshoulders/"&gt;DiyLilcnc&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//carbide3d.com/shapeoko/"&gt;Shapeoko&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/"&gt;X-Carve&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="//openbuilds.com/?category=cartesian-style-cnc&amp;amp;id=287"&gt;Openbuild community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled across the &lt;a href="//www.maslowcnc.com/"&gt;Maslow&lt;/a&gt; and got really excited. The large format capabilities (4'x8') with the really low price ($350) would leave more than enough in my budget to buy two machines.  In fact, I may be able to buy a Maslow and then use it to make the parts I would need another project like the DiyLilcnc (Although I just realized the kickstart for that is relly old 2011).  There are probably other projects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Maker"></category><category term="CNC"></category></entry><entry><title>Picking Blog Software</title><link href="//colbrydi.github.io/picking-blog-software.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Dr. Dirk Colbry</name></author><id>tag:colbrydi.github.io,2018-05-18:/picking-blog-software.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was at iCER we used confluence for our &lt;a href="//wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/~colbrydi@msu.edu/Dirk%27s+iCER+wiki+homepage"&gt;blogging software&lt;/a&gt; and when I did a (personal blog](//apprenticemaker.blogspot.com/) I used google blogger.

On of the barriers for me getting back into blogging (besides my own personal hangups) is that I was never really satisified with either solution.  I wanted to "own" my blog information and didn't really feel comfortable with advertisers making money directly from my content (this is it's own argument).  Here are some criteria for what I was looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to edit/ add new content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily backed up to my own computer and ported to a different system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to modify and add my own tweaks/ features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses markdown or some similar text based file format to make it easy to use linux commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some digging and talking to people I decided that I wanted to try out a static website generation tool and the obvious one that seemed to fit my interests and criteria is Pelican and a git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Pelican was not as easy as I had hoped.  On two different occasions over the last couple of years I have made a deliberate effort to build a new website using Pelican.  It "worked" but there was some missing feature or bug that would get in my way actually making me adopt the format.  I also think that my reluctance to post things makes it harder for me to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as I write this blog post (in markdown) I do not actually have a blog to post it on.  My hope is that having some posts already waiting "in the hopper" will make my use of the software easier.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of one of my summer students, I am making an effort to try to come up with a useable version of a blog using Pelican.  My feeling is that active open source projects are constantly evolving and therefore getting better. Maybe third time is a charm?  If Pelican still does not work out I may need to explore a different platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I would like a workflow that not only works for my blog but also for some of other projects that need websites.  I also would like to try to make a kind of Pelican template repository that I can give to some of my peers and make it quick and easy for them to start their own website/blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blogging"></category><category term="Product Reviews"></category></entry></feed>
