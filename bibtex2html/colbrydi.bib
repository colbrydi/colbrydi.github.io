The intention of this course is to prepare students from a variety of STEM backgrounds to be able to take on supportive roles in research labs while they are still undergraduates. To this end, students are taught common programming paradigms such as benchmarking, shared memory parallelization (OpenMP), accelerators (CUDA) and shared network parallelization (MPI). Students are also trained in practical skills including the Linux command line, workflow/file management, installing software, discovering and using shared module systems (LDMOD), and effectively submitting and monitoring jobs using a scheduler (SLURM).},

The growing need for CI Facilitation isn’t being met by traditional academic degree/certificate programs, so informal education is required. Since 2015, the Virtual Residency Program (VRP) has been teaching key CI Facilitation skills to pre-service and in-service CI Facilitators, at introductory, intermediate and advanced levels, via a combination of (a) workshops, (b) conference calls, and (c) apprenticeships. The demand for CI Facilitation has expanded exponentially, with the known CI Facilitator population growing from dozens in the late 2000s to over a thousand presently, so the need for this kind of training has become increasingly acute. The 2019 VRP workshop was presented at a combined introductory/intermediate level, with content suitable for both new and experienced CI Facilitators, to attract both of these populations, in many cases presenting the same topic first at the introductory level and then intermediate, to maximize impact. Since 2015, the VRP has served 924 participants from 370 institutions in every US state and 3 US territories plus 11 other countries.},

CI Professionals are experts at high performance computing, data science algorithms, and/or supercomputing infrastructure; they are often called upon to work with experts from STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) in multi-disciplinary teams to solve complex problems. The CyberAmbassadors training program seeks to improve the function of these teams by helping CI Professionals build and practice skills for effective communication, teamwork and leadership within the context of complex, multidisciplinary research. This paper summarizes the results of the pilot testing of the CyberAmbassadors curriculum, which was conducted at institutions across the United States using both in-person, online and hybrid delivery methods. A Kirkpatrick evaluation model was used to assess expectations and reasons for participation, as well as satisfaction with the training and impacts on participants’ learning and behavior. The curriculum was revised based on these initial pilot tests, and 43 volunteers have participated in “train the trainers” workshops to prepare to facilitate this training on a larger scale during 2019-20.},

	abstract = {Data centers have become a critical computing infrastructure in the era of cloud computing. Temperature monitoring and forecasting are essential for preventing overheating-induced server shutdowns and improving a data center's energy efficiency. This paper presents a novel cyber-physical approach for temperature forecasting in data centers, which integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling, in situ wireless sensing, and real-time data-driven prediction. To ensure the forecasting fidelity, we leverage the realistic physical thermodynamic models of CFD to generate transient temperature distribution and calibrate it using sensor feedback. Both simulated temperature distribution and sensor measurements are then used to train a real-time prediction algorithm. As a result, our approach significantly reduces the computational complexity of online temperature modeling and prediction, which enables a portable, noninvasive thermal monitoring solution that does not rely on the infrastructure of monitored data center. We extensively evaluated our system on a rack of 15 servers and a test bed of five racks and 229 servers in a production data center. Our results show that our system can predict the temperature evolution of servers with highly dynamic workloads at an average error of 0.52C, within a duration up to 10 minutes.},

Our code combines advantages of the DSMC and the Point of Closest Approach techniques for solving the collision integral. With that, it achieves high spatial accuracy in simulations of large particle systems while maintaining computational feasibility. Using particle mean free paths which are small with respect to the characteristic length scale of the simulated system, we reproduce hydrodynamic behavior. To demonstrate that our code can retrieve continuum solutions, we perform a test-suite of classic hydrodynamic shock problems consisting of the Sod, the Noh, and the Sedov tests. We find that the results of our simulations which apply millions of test-particles match the analytic solutions well. In addition, we take advantage of the ability of kinetic codes to describe matter out of the continuum regime when applying large particle mean free paths. With that, we study and compare the evolution of shock waves in the hydrodynamic limit and in a regime which is not reachable by hydrodynamic codes.},

	abstract = {Accelerometer based activity recognition systems have typically focused on recognizing simple ambulatory activities of daily life, such as walking, sitting, standing, climbing stairs, etc. In this work, we developed and evaluated algorithms for detecting and recognizing short duration hand movements (lift to mouth, scoop, stir, pour, unscrew cap). These actions are a part of the larger and complex Instrumental Activities of Daily Life (IADL) making a drink and drinking. We collected data using small wireless tri-axial accelerometers worn simultaneously on different parts of the hand. Acceleration data for training was collected from 5 subjects, who also performed the two IADLs without being given specific instructions on how to complete them. Feature vectors (mean, variance, correlation, spectral entropy and spectral energy) were calculated and tested on three classifiers (AdaBoost, HMM, k-NN). AdaBoost showed the best performance, with an overall accuracy of 86\% for detecting each of these hand actions. The results show that although some actions are recognized well with the generalized classifer trained on the subject-independent data, other actions require some amount of subject-specific training. We also observed an improvement in the performance of the system when multiple accelerometers placed on the right hand were used.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of turnkey, domain specific software packages are available to help users take advantage of advanced cyber-infrastructure and resources such as TeraGrid. However, novice users of cyber-infrastructure are often overwhelmed by the complexities of using cyber-infrastructure. For instance, the user may need to install multiple software tools just to connect with advanced hardware, and successfully installing and navigating this software frequently requires the use of Command Line Interfaces (CLI) that are unfamiliar to novice users. Even when applications provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI), special software (such as an X11 server) may be required to use the interface. Installing, configuring and running this software is generally a multi-step process that can be overly confusing to novice users and presents a barrier to entry, particularly in research domains not traditionally associated with advanced computation. Scientific gateways (such as the TeraGrid Portal [1]) are one possible solution to this problem. However, not all research projects or High Performance Computing (HPC) centers have the resources necessary to provide scientific gateways. We have developed an alternative solution: a "plug and play" HPC system portal stored on a USB thumb drive. The thumb drive contains all the software necessary to connect to traditional cyber-infrastructure and all programs run directly from the thumb drive -- no installation or setup is required. To access the software from a Windows-based machine, the user simply connects the thumb drive and runs the desired programs. The current thumb drive includes all the typical software necessary to connect to an HPC resource, such as X11 [2], ssh [3], and scp [4]. Since the software is pre-installed on the drive, it can also be preconfigured with the necessary preferences required to immediately connect to the resource. This presentation will describe the development process for the "Portable Apps" [5] HPC thumb drive, including lessons learned and suggestions for adapting the paradigm for other systems. The Portable Apps drive has been successfully distributed to both expert and novice HPC users at Michigan State University (MSU) and has proved to be a popular and easy-to-use tool for accessing local and national cyber-infrastructure resources, including TeraGrid [6]. This presentation will offer specific suggestions for adapting the Portable Apps idea (such as procedures for site specific applications [7]) and developing similar outreach and educational tools for other institutions and resources.},

	abstract = {The 3DID system verifies the identity of a cooperative person by matching a sensed 3D surface of the face to a face model stored during a prior enrollment. First, anchor point detection is performed based on a shape index; then, a rigid alignment is determined between the observed and model face anchor points. A best alignment is determined using an improved Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that aligns the surfaces allowing for trimming of 10\% noise points. Trimmed Root Mean Squared (RMS) error for the same person is almost always smaller than 1.3 mm; whereas for different persons, it is almost always larger than this threshold. Performance analysis shows that the 3DID system is fast enough ({\textless}2 s on a 3.2 MHz P4), reliable enough (1\% equal error rate with 1.5\% reject rate), and flexible enough (handles 30° of yaw and 15° of roll and pitch) to be practical in several applications. 3DID is also user friendly, providing several displays of intuitive value to human agents either in online or delayed analysis mode. An inexpensive scanner is needed for widespread use.},

Our algorithm automates the process of transforming a 3D face scan into its canonical representation, eliminating the need for hand-labeled anchor points. The presented algorithm is designed to be a robust, fully automatic preprocessor for any 3D face recognition algorithm. The experimental results presented here demonstrate that our CFDM is robust to noise and occlusion, and we show that using such a canonical representation can improve the efficiency efface recognition algorithms and reduce memory requirements. Producing the CFDM takes, on average, 0.85 seconds for 320 times 240 pixel scans, and 3.8 seconds for 640 times 480 pixel scans (using a dual AMD Opteron 275, 2.2 GHz, with 2 MB Cache, and 1 GIG RAM). The CFDM enables both 2D and 3D image processing methods - such as convolution and PCA - to be readily used for feature localization and face recognition.},

A prototype of this approach (called SEE-Segment) demonstrates the exploration of image segmentation using a single training example, although it is expected to have overfitting and generalization problems. SEE-Segment implements a solution to the Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter (CASH) Optimization problem and uses a genetic algorithm to search an "algorithm space" for solutions that may work for the provided problem. The output generated by SEE-Segment is standalone code that is not dependent on SEE-Segment and can easily be copied and pasted into researchers’ existing data processing workflows. Thus, SEE-Segment can also be seen as an educational tool that keeps the researchers "in the loop" and helps them to understand and use the segmentation algorithms that are available to them. This work will present preliminary results of running SEE-Segment on a variety of scientific image datasets and outline procedures to extend the approach to other annotation workflows by building an Image Annotation Grammar.},

	abstract = {Cities play a vital role in tackling sustainability challenges. Smart cities have emerged as solutions to urban sustainability. However, whether smart city practices lead to environmental, economic, and social sustainability outcomes is still not clear. This is due to a lack of thorough knowledge of how local governments have deployed the smart city notion, as well as a lack of holistic evaluation of sustainability outcomes achieved by smart cities. To fill in this gap, this research evaluates whether local implementation of smart cities is associated with sustainability outcomes at the city level. We studied 103 US cities by integrating a sustainability assessment conducted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and text mining of city official websites. Our analysis shows that more than 80\% of the 103 cities have smart city statements on their websites. In addition, smart cities generally score higher on sustainability outcomes than non-smart cities. Furthermore, when controlling for population size and geographic region, smart city mentions are positively associated with economic sustainability outcomes. However, the relationship between smart city mentions and environmental and social sustainability is not statistically significant. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the prevalence of local governments’ deployment of smart cities, which is scarce at present, and gives novel insight into the relationship between the use of technologies and urban sustainability.},

	abstract = {Agonistic behavior at feeding spaces is associated with both welfare and feed intake issues in swine farming. Studying interactive social behaviors of group-housed pigs provides valuable information to improve their production and welfare. The aims of this study were to (1) develop a deep learning pipeline based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to classify videos depicting four types of interactive behavior between pigs in a single-space feeding stall and (2) validate the CNN + LSTM pipeline through various blocked validation strategies. Four categories of behaviors were classified in this study: head-to-body contact (including gentle nosing, casual contact between head/ears of a pig with a feeding pig, head knocking, tail biting, and pushing); levering where the feeding pig was lifted from behind by another pig; mounting in which the feeding pig was mounted by another pig; and no-contact when a second pig entered the feeding stall without physical contact with the feeding pig. Behavior at the feeding stall was filmed twice, three weeks apart, for two consecutive days each week using six groups of grow-finish pigs (10 per group) housed in pens equipped with FIRE® feeders. This resulted in a total of 15,679 30-frame video episodes for classification. Random validation, blocking-by-time validation, and blocking-by-feeder validation were utilized for training-validation data split. The size of training sets was held constant (N = 7,500) through all validation scenarios. The average validation accuracies were 0.968(±0.001), 0.860(±0.033), 0.766(±0.026), and 0.860(±0.010) for random validation, blocking-by-time validation, and blocking-by-feeder validation (at Feeder 1 and at Feeder 2), respectively. The results indicate that the CNN + LSTM pipeline yielded acceptable predictive performance in random validation. However, performance was substantially worse in blocking-by-time and blocking-by-feeder validations. More work is needed for algorithm generalization to improve its robustness across a variety of real-life application scenarios. We provide public access to the dataset and the code.},

The workshop's discussion-oriented agenda focused on reproducibility in large-scale computational research. Two important themes capture the spirit of the workshop submissions and discussions: (1) organizational stakeholders, especially supercomputer centers, are in a unique position to promote, enable, and support reproducible research; and (2) individual researchers should conduct each experiment as though someone will replicate that experiment. Participants documented numerous issues, questions, technologies, practices, and potentially promising initiatives emerging from the discussion, but also highlighted four areas of particular interest to XSEDE: (1) documentation and training that promotes reproducible research; (2) system-level tools that provide build- and run-time information at the level of the individual job; (3) the need to model best practices in research collaborations involving XSEDE staff; and (4) continued work on gateways and related technologies. In addition, an intriguing question emerged from the day's interactions: would there be value in establishing an annual award for excellence in reproducible research?},

	abstract = {This paper presents some experiments to validate the design of an Automated Computer Vision (AutoCV) library for applications in scientific image understanding. AutoCV attempts to define a search space of algorithms used in common image analysis workflows and then uses a fitness function to automatically select individual algorithmic workflows for a given problem. The final goal is a semi-automated system that can assist researchers in finding specific computer vision algorithms that work for their specific research questions. As an example of this method the researchers have built the SEE-Insight tool which uses genetic algorithms to search for image analysis workflows. This tool has been used to implement an image segmentation workflow (SEE-Segment) and is being updated and modified to work with other image analysis workflows such as anchor point detection and counting. This work is motivated by analogous work being done in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). As a way to validate the approach, this paper uses the SEE-Insight tool to recreate an AutoML solution (called SEE-Classify) and compares results to an existing AutoML solution (TPOT). As expected the existing AutoML tool worked better than the prototype SEE-Classify tool. However, the goal of this work was to learn from these well-established tools and possibly identify one of them that could be modified as a mature replacement for the core SEE-Insight search algorithm. Although this drop-in replacement was not found, reproducing the AutoML experiments in the SEE-Insight framework provided quite a few insights into best practices for moving forward with this research.},

	abstract = {In this work, the use of transfer learning was explored to achieve the overall goal of classifying a small number (approx. 215 images) of Nonlinear Multiphoton Multimodal Microscopy Images of unstained oral cancer biopsies into three categories—healthy, inflammatory, and cancerous. This is achieved by first training a neural network model to detect basic histological components of human tissues, such as the stroma and mucosa, from a much larger (5,000 images) Kaggle data set containing images of stained human colorectal cancer biopsies. Experiments were conducted to optimize the model’s architecture and hyperparameters, i.e., hidden layers, optimizers, and API callback functions used prior to retraining the model on a new and much smaller data set consisting of 215 Nonlinear Multiphoton Multimodal Microscopy Images. In addition to having different class labels, these images were acquired using an entirely different imaging and detection set up, and thus have different features than the Kaggle data set. In order to expand the limited size of the Nonlinear Multiphoton Multimodal Microscopy Images data set; tiling methods were used to sub-sample and augment the images though standard transforms such as rotation, scaling and mirroring. This research shows transfer learning and data set re-sampling can improve classification accuracy by 10\% over training on the smaller data set alone.},

We developed a MATLAB-based quantitative histological analysis tool (QuHAnT) for the high-throughput assessment of distinguishable histological features. QuHAnT validation was demonstrated by comparison with manual quantitation using liver sections from mice orally gavaged with sesame oil vehicle or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; 0.001–30 μg/kg) every 4 days for 28 days, which elicits hepatic steatosis with mild fibrosis. A quality control module of QuHAnT reduced the number of quantifiable Oil Red O (ORO)-stained images from 3,123 to 2,756. Increased ORO staining was measured at 10 and 30 μg/kg TCDD with a high correlation between manual and computational volume densities (Vv), although the dynamic range of QuHAnT was 10-fold greater. Additionally, QuHAnT determined the size of each ORO vacuole, which could not be accurately quantitated by visual examination or manual point counting. PicroSirius Red quantitation demonstrated superior collagen deposition detection due to the ability to consider all images within each section. QuHAnT dramatically reduced analysis time and facilitated the comprehensive assessment of features improving accuracy and sensitivity and represents a complementary tool for tissue/cellular features that are difficult and tedious to assess via subjective or semiquantitative methods.},

Our method combines the traditional Monte Carlo technique to efficiently propagate particles and the point-of-closest-approach method for high spatial resolution. Simulations are performed using different particle mean free paths and we compare the results to linear theory predictions for the growth rate including diffusion and viscosity. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and simulations and, at late times, observe the development of secondary instabilities, similar to hydrodynamic simulations and experiments. Large mean free paths favor particle diffusion, reduce the occurrence of secondary instabilities, and approach the noninteracting gas limit.},

	abstract = {Cyberinfrastructure facilitation -- working directly with researchers to advance the computing-intensive and data-intensive aspects of their investigations, especially via large-scale and advanced computing -- has emerged as a crucial component of research computing processes. However, because no national formal education curriculum exists to cultivate the needed workforce, informal education is the most viable approach. The Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Research and Education Facilitator (ACI-REF) Virtual Residency (VR) program, in operation since summer 2015, is a national informal education program that trains Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Facilitators on effective methods for serving their research and education constituents, especially focusing on professional (soft) skills (because much of the technical content that facilitators need is available via other opportunities). The VR consists primarily of (a) summer weeklong intensive workshops that provide both content and experiences in facilitation, (b) biweekly conference calls that expand upon both the kinds of topics introduced in the workshops and additional content and experiences, (c) meetings at national conferences and (d) a grant proposal writing apprenticeship. Future plans focus on extending the VR model to intermediate and advanced levels, as well as disseminating a "train-the-trainers-of-trainers" approach to teaching other organizations to conduct their own VR activities within their own CI Facilitator communities, in order to expand the VR's scale, scope, and reach. The VR program and its offshoots have already served 364 CI professionals at 188 institutions across the US and internationally. Virtual Residents are positioned to advance to the intermediate level and beyond, and ultimately to become institutional and national CI leaders.},

	abstract = {Automatic pig feeders record individual feeding behavior traits that can be used in genetic selection. However, these feeders cannot measure how feeding traits are affected by behavioral interactions between animals. Moreover, recording behavioral interactions can improve the estimation of social genetic effects. This motivated our assessment of computer vision to classify 4 types of interactions at the feeder: head-to-body contact (HB) including head knocking, tail biting, pushing, gentle nosing and casual contact between head/ears of a pig with a feeding pig; levering (L) where the feeding pig was lifted from behind by another pig; mounting (M) where the feeding pig was mounted by another pig; and no-contact (NC) when a second pig entered the feeder without touching the feeding pig. Behavior at the feeder was filmed twice, 3 weeks apart, for 2 consecutive days each week in 6 groups of grow-finish pigs (10 per group) housed in pens equipped with FIRE feeders. Video segments that involved 2 pigs in the feeder were selected, and labeled as HB (n=10,114), L (n=925), M (n=1,242) and NC (n=3,398). Due to the sparse data available for training and the complex nature of the behavioral interactions, we utilized pretrained convolutional neural networks for automatic spatial feature extraction followed by long short-term memory for temporal feature extraction from sequences of frames. Focal loss, a loss function that assigns different weights to hard/easily misclassified examples to handle class imbalance problem, was used in this study. Accuracy, recall, and precision of behavior classification were obtained from 5 random cross-validations. The overall accuracy was 0.967±0.002. The average recalls for HB, L, M, and NC were 0.977±0.004, 0.866±0.047, 0.969±0.011, and 0.964±0.009 respectively, while average precisions were 0.976±0.002, 0.901±0.029, 0.956±0.018, and 0.963±0.012. The proposed algorithm accurately classified multiple interactive behaviors in an automated feeding stall from digital videos.},

	abstract = {Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Facilitation amplifies the productivity of researchers engaged in computing-intensive and data-intensive investigations. CI Facilitators help researchers to adapt their workflows to CI resources, and teaches these researchers how to use these systems, bridging between researchers and technology experts. The importance of CI Facilitators is well understood, and there is broad consensus about their need for ongoing training, especially because of not only their highly diverse career backgrounds and domains of expertise, but also the rapid advancement of CI technologies. The Virtual Residency Program (VRP) has been addressing this training gap since 2015, offering summer workshops that teach key CI Facilitation skills. These workshops are community driven and community developed. The 2020 VRP workshop, for the first time, featured an external evaluation of the efficacy and value of the workshop. This paper examines the results of that evaluation, to determine the value of the VRP to the CI Facilitator community, and thus to the many researchers these CI Facilitators serve. Since 2015, all VRP activities collectively ave had a total of 953 participants, from 381 institutions in every US state and 3 US territories plus 12 other countries on 5 continents.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.5565/rev/elcvia.1941},
	abstract = {This work introduces two new distance metrics for comparing labeled arrays, which are common outputs
of image segmentation algorithms. Each pixel in an image is assigned a label, with binary segmentation
providing only two labels (‘foreground’ and ‘background’). These can be represented by a simple binary
matrix and compared using pixel differences. However, many segmentation algorithms output multiple
regions in a labeled array. We propose two distance metrics, named LAD and MADLAD, that calculate the
distance between two labeled images. By doing so, the accuracy of different image segmentation algorithms
can be evaluated by measuring their outputs against a ‘ground truth’ labeling. Both proposed metrics,
operating with a complexity of O(N ) for images with N pixels, are designed to quickly identify similar
labeled arrays, even when different labeling methods are used. Comparisons are made between images
labeled manually and those labeled by segmentation algorithms. This evaluation is crucial when searching
through a space of segmentation algorithms and their hyperparameters via a genetic algorithm to identify
the optimal solution for automated segmentation, which is the goal in our lab, SEE-Insight. By measuring
the distance from the ground truth, these metrics help determine which algorithm provides the most accurate
segmentation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents some experiments to validate the design of an Automated Computer Vision (AutoCV) library for applications in scientific image understanding. AutoCV attempts to define a search space of algorithms used in common image analysis workflows and then uses a fitness function to automatically select individual algorithmic workflows for a given problem. The final goal is a semi-automated system that can assist researchers in finding specific computer vision algorithms that work for their specific research questions. As an example of this method the researchers have built the SEE-Insight tool which uses genetic algorithms to search for image analysis workflows. This tool has been used to implement an image segmentation workflow (SEE-Segment) and is being updated and modified to work with other image analysis workflows such as anchor point detection and counting. This work is motivated by analogous work being done in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). As a way to validate the approach, this paper uses the SEE-Insight tool to recreate an AutoML solution (called SEE-Classify) and compares results to an existing AutoML solution (TPOT). As expected the existing AutoML tool worked better than the prototype SEE-Classify tool. However, the goal of this work was to learn from these well-established tools and possibly identify one of them that could be modified as a mature replacement for the core SEE-Insight search algorithm. Although this drop-in replacement was not found, reproducing the AutoML experiments in the SEE-Insight framework provided quite a few insights into best practices for moving forward with this research.},
